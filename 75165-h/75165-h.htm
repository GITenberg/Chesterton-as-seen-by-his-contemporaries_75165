<span class="subhead1">by E.&nbsp;C. Bentley</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. Cyril Clemens’ book about Gilbert
Chesterton is of an unusual and, to
my taste, a deeply interesting sort.
Some one has remarked that the most
satisfactory biographies were those in
which the letters and journals of the
subject bulked largest, since these, telling
their own tale, showed the man
better than any biographer could do it.
Mr. Clemens has assembled a vast
number of other people’s memories and
appreciations of G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.; and it may
be said that they show the attitude of
his contemporaries towards him better
than any individual critic could describe
it.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable note of unanimity
in these personal recollections and
judgments. There are differences of
view about the value of G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.’s work;
about the relative importance of this or
that of its many aspects; about his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ii">ii</span>
matter or style in lecturing; about the
quality of his wit, and many points
more. But as to the nature of the man
as he was there is hardly any difference
at all. He won the hearts of those who
met him because of his manifest goodness
of heart and happiness of temper;
these things were as apparent to all
who came near him as was his physical
being.</p>

<p>I do not imagine that Mr. Clemens
asked me to write this introduction
with the idea of my setting forth any
opinions about the place of G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. in
our literature. I could offer none of
any critical value, because for me the
man and his work have always been
one, and I have been for most of my
life intensely prejudiced in favour of
the man. Mr. Clemens knew of me, I
suppose, as a boyhood friend of G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.—as
I appear in his Autobiography—and
perhaps as having dedicated a book
of mine to him in terms which told
some fraction of what my feeling towards
him was. I may, then, say now
that I first met him at that time of life
when personal influence counts for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iii">iii</span>
most, and one’s nature is in the making
for good or evil. His friendship was
the best thing that ever happened to
me, and I have always thanked God
for it.</p>

<p>Essential goodness, perfect sincerity,
chivalrous generosity, boundless good-temper,
a total absence of self-esteem—these
are lovable traits; and with
them, even in boyhood, were united brilliant
intellectual powers and an enormous
gift of humor. The effect of it
all on an impressionable youth of fifteen
or so can perhaps be guessed. For
years we were as near to each other as
it is possible for friends to be, I think;
but there was no one who knew him
even slightly that did not feel something
of the spiritual attraction that he
exercised—always in utter unconsciousness
of it.</p>

<p>G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. was too conspicuously unlike
the ordinary boy to be popular, in the
sense of being on the best of terms with
all and sundry. He was without any
desire to excel or take the lead in any
direction. He was unconscious of the
very existence of games. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
steeped in literature and art; and he
could, at need, be perfectly happy with
his own thoughts and the fruits of his
imagination. He was, on the other
hand, not unpopular; it was impossible
for even an ill-natured boy, I should
think, to dislike him; but his circle of
friends was small in those early days.
I have written something about this
time of our lives to Mr. Clemens who
has quoted it at the outset of this book.
What I have been saying in this place
is an attempt to express what Gilbert
Chesterton meant to me.</p>

<p>That circle of friends which was so
small was to become as wide as any
man’s of our time, as the recognition of
his genius increased, and the magic of
his personality gained greater scope.
No death can ever have been mourned
with a deeper sincerity of personal affection
by so many, in his own country
and in others.</p>

<span class="subhead">BOYHOOD DAYS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One of Chesterton’s earliest and
staunchest friends, Mr. E.&nbsp;C. Bentley,
recalls,</p>

<p>“Chesterton was in his schooldays
the centre of a small group of boys.
They formed a club under his chairmanship
... the Junior Debating Club,
so called to distinguish it from the
School Union Society, which was the
preserve of the senior boys. He never
did, as he states in his memoirs, any
work at school in the academic sense,
and so never rose to the position of a
star boy. The star boys did not understand
him and classed him as a freak
who was unlikely to do the school any
credit. He was so exceptionally untidy
and absent-minded, even at the age
when the ordinary boy becomes careful
of his appearance, that he did not fit
into the picture at all; and it needed
the insight of Walker, the High Master
of his day, to divine that there was the
stuff of genius in him, and to ordain
(as G.&nbsp;K. tells in his own modest way)
that on the strength of a remarkable
prize poem ... the only ‘regular’ thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
he ever did at school ... he should
‘rank with the eighth form,’ the highest,
to which he would never have attained
on his school performance. Very
few of the boys of whom he saw most
did anything in the field of letters in
after life.” The poet Edward Thomas
was not at St. Paul’s with G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. as
many think. Mr. Robert Eckert, the biographer
of Thomas, states that the
latter was a schoolmate of Cecil,
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.’s younger brother.</p>

<p>Mr. Bentley continues: “About
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.:—His spare time at school—which,
as he makes clear in his Autobiography,
was mostly spent.... I
should say entirely ... in talking, reading,
writing, and drawing pictures. He
had a wonderful decorative handwriting,
and was already a masterly
draughtsman. Apart from walking, of
which he never tired as a boy, he took
no part in any sport. His sight was
always very bad without his glasses.
He was nevertheless strong and healthy
as a boy, rather slim than otherwise; it
was not until the twenties that he began
to put on flesh. It was not ordinary
fatness; I believe some gland trouble
must have been at the root of it.</p>

<p>“Speaking generally, Chesterton would
talk about everything when at school
that had to do with the realm of ideas.
He never took much interest in things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
that are called practical. Politics in a
broad sense he would talk about, but
for the details of legislation he cared
nothing. He always was, of course,
what we know as a Liberal; in the
large sense he remained a Liberal all
his days.</p>

<p>“Literature he would discuss by the
hour, especially poetry. He hated the
fashionable decadence of that time ...
say 1890–1900 ... as may be seen
from the dedication to ‘The Man
Who Was Thursday.’ He delighted in
pictorial art, above all in the generous
idealism of G.&nbsp;F. Watts.</p>

<p>“As to books, G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. never gave any
attention to those which constituted
school-work. He was passionately fond
of Scott and of course, Dickens. He
knew Tennyson, Browning, Swinburne
by heart, and had enjoyed every other
English poet in large degree. He did
not care in those days for lighter reading.</p>

<p>“There was a school library, but it was
reserved for the use of the highest class
in the school, which G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. never attained.
There was a popular fiction library
also, but he did not, I think, make
use of it. G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. was too amiable to
get into fights, but he would use his
strength occasionally in standing between
a small boy and others who were
badgering him. He honored religion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
but had none whatever of a doctrinal
kind until years later.”</p>

<p>“Chesterton, as I knew him in 1889,”
writes Mr. E.&nbsp;W. Fordham, another old
schoolmate, “was utterly unlike the
average English schoolboy. He took no
part in games. He showed no particular
brilliance as a scholar, and yet far
from being looked down upon, he was, I
think, always regarded as one who lived
in a different mental world from the
rest of us, a world that many of us admired
from afar but would never expect,
or, it may be, ever hope to enter.
We felt, though we never alluded to,
his mental pre-eminence. Thus when
the Junior Debating Club was formed,
G.&nbsp;K. became Chairman without question
and without a rival. It was obvious
that he alone was fitted for the
post, and most admirably he filled it.
The teas at the houses of the various
members of the Club which preceded
the debates were often tempestuous to
the last degree, but Gilbert, although
he took no share in the more physical
aspects of our revelry, was very far
from playing the part of a wet blanket.</p>

<p>“His laugh was the loudest and the
most infectious of all. There were
times when the boisterous manifestations
of some of us overflowed into, and
tended to overpower, the Debates. Then,
with the utmost good temper, G.&nbsp;K.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
would assert himself, and order would
be restored.</p>

<p>“I remember once, after I myself had
been particularly noisy and troublesome,
Gilbert explained to me that the
throwing of buns and slices of cake did
not really help in the production of
good debates, and he hinted, very kindly
and seriously, that some restraining
action might have to be taken if the
rioting did not diminish. I hope, indeed,
I believe, I took the hint. This
occasion was thereafter referred to as
the day ‘when the Chairman spoke seriously
to Mr. F.’</p>

<p>“G.&nbsp;K. was the mainspring of the
Junior Debating Club. He was valiantly
supported by Oldershaw, Bentley,
and others, but without him neither the
Club itself, nor that strange little magazine,
‘The Debater’ could have flourished
as each of them did. Like boy,
like man. That which he believed in
he put his whole heart into, and never
spared himself in furthering its interests.
He gave the Junior Debating
Club his eager and inspiring support
for the two very good reasons, that it
gave great enjoyment to himself and a
few of his friends, and that he thought
it a widening and humanizing influence—completely
outside the range of ordinary
school affairs. The Chairman
loved the Junior Debating Club, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
most certainly the J.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;C. loved the
Chairman.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fordham pins further recollections
around the “Autobiography”:</p>

<p>“I am a prejudiced person. Fifty
years of friendship and admiration are
an insuperable bar to impartiality.</p>

<p>“G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. and I were at school together:
we were fellow members of the
Junior Debating Club of which he was
Chairman. We both contributed to our
Club’s magazine, ‘The Debater.’ I
wrote rubbish; he wrote articles and
verses of a very different quality. In
this book he speaks almost with contempt
of his ‘juvenilia.’ They were in
fact such as very few boys of his age
could have produced. Even then, at the
age of fifteen or sixteen, he had a
sense of style and a command of language
which the High Master of St.
Paul’s and other authorities did not fail
to recognize. ‘The Dragon,’ one article
begins, ‘the Dragon is the most
cosmopolitan of impossibilities.’</p>

<p>“As I say, I admired Gilbert Chesterton
throughout his life, and after reading
his ‘Autobiography’ I admire him
still more. My attitude is rather that of
a hero-worshipper than a critic, but I
believe that no impartial critic could
read this book and fail to see that here
was a genius, and better, a brave and
an honest man, a man who loved life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
and loved his friends, loved laughter
and hated oppression; in short a very
great man. Despite all the modesty
with which it is written, the book makes
all these things clear. From beginning
to end it is a magnificent <em lang="la">apologia pro
vita sua</em>; nevertheless I hope it will not
be the sole record of his life. There are
countless things that he could not and
would not tell of himself but that should
not be forgotten. ‘Belloc,’ he writes,
‘still awaits a Boswell.’ It is equally
true that Chesterton awaits one. Is it
legitimate to hope that his Boswell may
be Belloc? There is a grand harvest to
be gathered by his Boswell, whoever
that may prove to be. G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. was a
brilliant talker. He banished dullness
from whatever company he was in. No
argument arose but he would drive
home his point by some arresting illustration.
We were arguing once as to
whether some policy or other were good
or bad. ‘The word ‘good,’ said G.&nbsp;K.,
‘has many meanings. For example, if
a man were to shoot his grandmother
at a range of 500 yards I should call him
a good shot, but not necessarily a good
man.’</p>

<p>“No one could stump him by an unexpected
question. He took part in a
debate many years ago at, I think, the
Lyceum Club, and in the course of his
speech he discussed, as did other speakers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
various racial characteristics. After
the debate I was walking round with
him when an elderly lady whom he did
not know came up and said with something
of a simper, ‘Mr. Chesterton, I
wonder if you could tell what race I
belong to?’ With a characteristic adjustment
of his glasses he replied at
once, ‘I should certainly say, Madam,
one of the conquering races.’</p>

<p>“Only a year or two ago he watched
with tolerant, and indeed highly vocal
amusement, (his was both the strangest
and the jolliest laugh man ever had) a
representation of himself in some private
theatricals. When they were over
he said to the daughter of the player
who had impersonated him—a sturdy
figure, it is true, but less generously
planned than the original—‘Do you
know I believe your father <b>is</b> Gilbert
Chesterton and I am only a padded impostor.’</p>

<p>“Reading this book has recalled these
trifles to my mind just as it has recalled
the figure of the boy Chesterton as I
first knew him in the early nineties. I
can see him now, very tall and lanky,
striding untidily along Kensington High
Street, smiling and sometimes scowling
as he talked to himself, apparently oblivious
of everything he passed, but in
reality a far closer observer than most,
and one who not only observed but remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
what he had seen. The fascination
of this book is, in great part,
due to the fact that he retained these
powers of observation and memory
throughout his life, and that he has applied
them to himself as rigorously and
as vividly as to his fellows.</p>

<p>“‘I should thank God for my creation,’
said Gilbert’s grandfather, ‘if I
knew I was a lost soul.’ Gilbert would
have done the same. ‘The primary problem
for me,’ he writes, ‘was the problem
of how men could be made to realize
the wonder and splendour of being
alive,’ and it is because he himself did
realize it that he is able to say of his
later years, ‘I have grown old without
being bored. Existence is still a strange
thing to me, and as a stranger I give
it welcome.’</p>

<p>“Chesterton begins this book with a
joke about his baptism. It is characteristic
of the man. He loved laughter as
much as he hated hypocrisy. ‘I have
never understood,’ he says, ‘why a
solid argument is any less solid because
you make the illustrations as entertaining
as you can.’ It is because, in this
autobiography the philosophy is spiced
with fun, and the fun sometimes spiced
with philosophy, that so true a picture
of the man emerges from the book.
When he looks at himself he sees not
only an intensely interesting being but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
also an intensely amusing one. He
speaks of his school days as the period
during which ‘I was being instructed
by somebody I did not know, about
something I did not want to know.’ He
tells how on his wedding day he stopped
to buy a glass of milk at some haunt of
his infancy, and again to buy a revolver
and cartridges ‘with a general notion
of protecting my bride from the pirates
doubtless infesting the Norfolk Broads.’</p>

<p>“You will find the same amusement he
found if you read and re-read his chapter
on ‘Friendship and Foolery,’ his story
of the sudden invasion of Henry James’
house at Rye by Mr. Belloc and another,
unshaven and dishevelled but vociferous
and irrepressible, his account of the
birthday dinner to Mr. Belloc at which
there were to be no speeches, and at
which everybody present spoke, and his
story of the aged negro porter in America
with a face like a walnut whom,
he says, ‘I discouraged from brushing
my hat, and who rebuked me saying,
‘Ho, young man, yo’s losing ye dignity
before yo times. Yo’s got to look nice
for the girls.’</p>

<p>“The sketches of his friends and those
of the many public men with whom he
came in contact are of extraordinary
interest. In a few lines he paints sharp
and unforgettable portraits not only of
his intimate friends but of men and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
women with whom he had perhaps but
one short conversation. It is thus he
tells of his meeting with King George V
at the house of the late Lord Burnham.
He sums up his impression of ‘about as
genuine a person as I ever met’ in these
words—‘If it should ever happen that
I hear before I die among new generations
who never saw George the Fifth
that he is being praised either as a
strong silent man, or depreciated as a
stupid and empty man, I shall know
that history has got the whole portrait
wrong.’</p>

<p>“There are brilliant little sketches of
George Wyndham, Charles Masterman
and Cunninghame Graham, among many
others; of each one it is the true thing
and the generous thing that he sets
down. No less arresting are the little
cameos of wholly unknown men and
women who said or did something that
left an impression on his receptive and
retentive mind. For example there was
the ‘huge healthy simple-faced man of
the plastering profession’ who at a
Penny Reading, being unable to endure
further recitations about to be provided
by a gentleman who had already
obliged with ‘The Charge of the Light
Brigade’ and ‘The May Queen,’ ‘arose
slowly in the middle of the room like
some vast Leviathan arising from the
ocean and observed, ‘Well, I’ve just ’ad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
about enough of this. <em>Good</em> evening,
Mr. Ash. <em>Good</em> evening, ladies and gentlemen,’
and shouldered his way out of
the Progressive Hall with an unaffected
air of complete amiability and profound
relief.’</p>

<p>“Memorable as are all the records of
his outer life, the insight that he gives
us into his mental and spiritual development
is of deeper significance. It would
be impossible, for me at least, to summarize
the subjective side of this autobiography.
To be understood, even to
be partly understood, it must be read
in its entirety. Many readers will not
be able to accept the conclusions to
which Chesterton found himself inevitably
driven, but none can fail to see
that his steadfast faith, his sure hope,
and his abounding charity were the outcome
of no slipshod or haphazard
thought, but of mental processes to
which he gave the whole of his clear
and original mind, and that in his life-long
struggle towards the light which
he felt assured he had ultimately found
he was as completely honest with himself
as he always was in his dealings
with his fellow men.</p>

<p>“This is a noble record of a noble
life.”</p>

<span class="subhead">LITERARY APPRENTICESHIP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Chesterton had a shorter apprenticeship
for a writing career than most men
of letters. After leaving St. Paul’s he
went to the Slade Art School where he
graduated in 1891 at the age of seventeen.
He forthwith began reviewing
books on art for the “Bookman,” the
“Speaker,” and other periodicals. In
1901 he married Frances Blogg whom
he had known for some time. Among
those present at the wedding was Miss
Elizabeth Yeats, the sister of the poet
William Butler Yeats, who recalls,</p>

<p>“My sister and I were at the Chesterton’s
wedding at St. Mary’s Abbots
in Kensington. Gilbert wanted the ceremony
as ceremonial as possible—but
Frances, who then belonged to some
new thought people in religious matters,
wanted everything possible cut
from the Church of England Service—except
just the legal parts. Gilbert
had been, of course, brought up a nonconformist.”</p>

<p>Chesterton’s marriage was the beginning
of thirty-five years of happiness
with a wife who was ideally congenial.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">A</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>His first book “Greybeards at Play,”
consisting of jingles and sketches, had
appeared in 1894. As time went on he
gradually found the expression of ideas
more satisfying than any kind of art
work.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">A</a> Frances Chesterton died December 12, 1938.</p>

</div>

<p>From 1898 to 1901 he and his brother
Cecil helped Hilaire Belloc on “The New
Witness,” a weekly paper pledged to
wage eternal against political corruption.
Some years earlier he had severed
his connections with socialism and
adopted Belloc’s ideas now known as
“Distributism,” the progress of which
was to be ultimately chronicled by the
famous “G.&nbsp;K.’s Weekly” founded in
1926.</p>

<p>Stephen Gwynn recalls the first book
written for Macmillan.</p>

<p>“It is so long ago that I only dimly
remember my first encounter with
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. He was married and they let
a flat—Battersea Park—a tiny flat—in
1901. I never knew two people
who changed less in nearly forty years.</p>

<p>“On my advice the Macmillans had
asked him to do Browning in the ‘English
Men of Letters,’ when he was still
not quite arrived. Old Mr. Craik, the
Senior Partner, sent for me and I found
him in white fury, with Chesterton’s
proofs corrected in pencil; or rather not
corrected; there were still thirteen errors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
uncorrected on one page; mostly in
quotations from Browning. A selection
from a Scotch ballad had been quoted
from memory and three of the four
lines were wrong. I wrote to Chesterton
saying that the firm thought the
book was going to “disgrace” them.
His reply was like the trumpeting of
a crushed elephant. But the book was
a huge success as it deserved to be.”</p>

<p>J. Lewis May writes about another
early book,</p>

<p>“A book that created something of a
sensation in its day was the penetrating
study of George Bernard Shaw by
Chesterton. The mention of Chesterton
reminds me that it was Lane who
published his ‘Orthodoxy’ and his
‘Napoleon of Notting Hill,’ as well as
‘Heretics.’ Those, I think, were in the
days before the royalty system came in,
and I fancy Lane bought them outright.
It was in regard to the
first that I heard that Chesterton
brought it in chapter by chapter as he
wrote it, and it was written on any
miscellaneous scraps of paper that
came to his hand. He did not disdain,
I have been told, even the paper that
sugar is wrapped in, for the purpose of
recording his valuable thoughts. Anatole
France was accustomed to use the
inside of envelopes or the backs of bills
for the same object.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>William Platt gave Chesterton encouragement
at the start,</p>

<p>“We are all aware that one of G.&nbsp;K.
C.’s first successes was by a series of
articles signed ‘The Defendant’ each one
being headed ‘In Defense of....’</p>

<p>“I wrote immediately to the clever
young ‘Defendant’ telling him of the
certainty of his future as a writer. He
immediately came ’round to see me.
Tall, young, handsome, vivacious. At
once we fraternized.</p>

<p>“After that our trends in life became
rather diverse. We met occasionally,
chiefly at public gatherings in London.
At rare intervals we exchanged letters.
But G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. never forgot my early prediction
of his inevitable rise to fame, or
the many things we had in common, in
his sense of knight-errantry and mine.
In any hall the moment he caught sight
of me he would greet me with his radiant
smile, or, if free, he would at once
come over to me.”</p>

<p>A newspaperman once asked Chesterton
what he considered his first most
important book,</p>

<p>“‘Napoleon of Notting Hill’ and I almost
missed writing it. If I hadn’t
written it, I would have stopped writing.
I was what you Americans call
‘broke’—only ten shillings in my pocket.
Leaving my worried wife, I went down
Fleet Street, got a shave, and then ordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
for myself, at the Cheshire
Cheese, an enormous luncheon of my
favorite dishes and a bottle of wine. It
took my all, but I could then go to my
publishers fortified. I told them I
wanted to write a book and outlined the
story of ‘Napoleon of Notting Hill.’ But
I must have twenty pounds, I said, before
I begin.</p>

<p>“‘We will send it to you on Monday.’</p>

<p>“‘If you want the book,’ I replied,
‘you will have to give it to me today as
I am disappearing to write it.’ They
gave it.</p>

<p>“Later Chesterton said, ‘What a fool
a man is, when he comes to the last
ditch, not to spend the last farthing to
satisfy the inner man before he goes
out to fight a battle with wits.’”</p>

<p>Just before the War the Irish Lit-er-a-ry
Society had a debate at which
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. was the principal speaker: the
Chairman being Stephen Gwynn, and
among the other speakers was Jimmy
Glover at that time conductor of the
Drury Lane orchestra, whose father
published the collected edition of Tom
Moore’s melodies. In introducing Chesterton,
Stephen Gwynn chipped him on
his life of Browning in the “English
Men of Letters Series,” and on certain
mistakes he had made on it, and wondered
why he had undertaken a subject,
about which he apparently knew so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
little. Chesterton, with his usual
chuckle and wiping the perspiration
from his face on to the lapels of his
frock coat, retorted that he had had
some doubts on the undertaking, but
when he had discovered in the series
entitled “English Men of Letters,” a
life written by an Irishman (Stephen
Gwynn) on another Irishman (Tom
Moore) he had no further qualms in
the matter. The back-chat continued
for a time, and Mr. Boyle recalls, ended
by Chesterton suggesting that he
should get on with the subject of the
evening and then proceed with the important
matter before them, which was
the weighing of himself against Jimmy
Glover who had had the audacity to
state that he was heavier than the famous
author. After the meeting George
Boyle had a few words with G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.
and reminded him that he was in St.
Paul’s School with him but that he had
been in a higher class than himself.
With the same good-natured chuckle
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. said this was quite impossible
as he had always remained in the very
lowest class he could while at that
school.</p>

<p>As known from his “Autobiography,”
Chesterton wrote a great deal for “The
Speaker” under J.&nbsp;L. Hammond’s editorship.
The latter came to know him
through L.&nbsp;R. Oldershaw (an old school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
friend of his who shared rooms with
Hammond at that time in the Temple.)
Oldershaw wrote for “The Speaker”
(mainly fiction reviewing) and he
brought Chesterton to see Hammond.
As we can imagine he made a deep impression
on Hammond, and on the other
young men who worked for “The
Speaker.” The first contribution he
made was an article on Ruskin in the
form of a review of a life by W.&nbsp;G.
Collingwood. This appeared on April
26th, 1900. The first number of “The
Speaker” after it had passed into the
hands of a group of Liberals to which
Hammond belonged, was published at
the beginning of October, 1899.</p>

<p>Chesterton wrote much during the
Boer War, including some excellent
skits on Chamberlain and other topics
at the General Election of 1900.</p>

<p>F.&nbsp;W. Hirst has recollections about
“The Speaker”:</p>

<p>“As regards G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton, I was
partly responsible for publishing his
early contributions to ‘The Speaker’
which I helped edit from 1899 (when I
first met him) until after the end of
the Boer War. My political cooperation
with Chesterton (and Belloc) was
mainly due to our antipathy to aggressive
imperialism which was shared with
Mark Twain.”</p>

<span class="subhead">MEETINGS WITH G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Miss Alice Henry of Melbourne,
Australia, has kindly pointed out to
the author that the following is something
which has never had any but
ephemeral publication in a newspaper,
and yet it is surely one of the most
striking messages he ever uttered.
Chesterton was the one British writer,
utterly unknown before, who built up a
great reputation during the South
African War, and it was gained, not
through nationalistic support, but
through determined and persistent opposition
to the British policy. After the
war ended, he ran a column in the
“London Daily News.” A correspondent
had asked him for a definition of
his anti-war attitude. This was his
reply,</p>

<p>“The unreasonable patriot is one who
sees the faults of his fatherland with
an eye which is clearer and more merciless
than any eye of hatred, the eye of
an irrational and irrevocable love.”</p>

<p>The reader will recall that in his
“Autobiography” Chesterton states that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
it was in Fleet Street that he first met
Sir Philip Gibbs “who carried a curious
air of being the right man in the wrong
place.”</p>

<p>However, in a letter to the author,
Sir Philip disagrees with this,</p>

<p>“As regards G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C., he was a good
friend of mine and has placed me on
record in his ‘Autobiography’ as ‘the
right man in the wrong place’—though
as a matter of fact I claim to have been
the right man in the right place—which
was Fleet Street, where he and
I met many times as writers for the
Press. His books belong to my mental
library and he will live in English literature
as one of our great essayists,
and above all as a good poet.”</p>

<p>Sir Oliver Lodge recalls:</p>

<p>“G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. at one time lived at the
set of flats in Artillery Mansions where
I had one of them, and I used to meet
him outside sometimes waiting for a
cab in the street and had a few words
with him. I also met him at the Synthetic
Society dinners, and once I impounded
a piece of blotting-paper on
which he had made a lot of characteristic
scribbles (clever sketches of
faces) absentmindedly during a discussion
at one of these dinners.”</p>

<p>Robert Blatchford, the well known
editor of “The Clarion” and author of
“Merrie England,” who was born away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
back in 1851, tells of a long controversy
he had with Chesterton in the
press some thirty years ago about determinism:
“Some years later he wrote
in some paper, I forgot which, and paid
me the finest compliment I ever received.
He said,</p>

<p>“‘Very few intellectual minds have
left such a mark on our time: have cut
so deep or remained so clean. His case
for Socialism, so far as it goes, is so
clear and simple that any one would
understand it when it was put properly:
his genius was that he could put it properly.
His triumphs were triumphs of
strong style, active pathos, and picturesque
metaphor: his very lucidity
was a generous sympathy with simple
minds. For the rest he had triumphed
with being honest and by not being
afraid.’</p>

<p>“Now in paying me that compliment
he complimented himself, for only a
very warm-hearted and generous man
could have treated an opponent with
such gallantry and kindness. But you
cannot publish that tribute without giving
the impression that I am fishing
for a cheap advertisement.</p>

<p>“Then as to his books. I liked what
he wrote about Dickens and some of his
poetry, and I recognize his brilliance:
but a good deal of his work I found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
rather tiresome, and you cannot publish
such an opinion.</p>

<p>“We met several times and got on
quite pleasantly together.”</p>

<p>W.&nbsp;W. Jacobs, the author of “Many
Cargoes,” recollects,</p>

<p>“I cannot recall my first meeting
with Chesterton: it was so very long
ago. But I do remember an occasion
when he sat next to me at dinner and
said that he had rheumatism so badly
that he did not know how he would be
able to stand up for his speech. A difficulty
which he solved by keeping my
right shoulder in a strong hand and
bearing down upon it. It was a good
speech, but it seemed to be the longest
I had ever listened to.”</p>

<p>“I regret that I never met G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.
personally,” laments James Hilton, “but
I did when quite a small boy send him
a poem I had written (a drinking song
as a matter of fact), modeled after his
own style, and received a charming letter
from his wife, I think, saying that
he had been much interested and ‘believed
that after the war there would
be a great recrudescence of drinking
songs.’ This was my first letter from
even the wife of a celebrity and I was
very proud of it. As a matter of fact,
in my entire life I have only written
anything you could call fan letters to
two authors, Chesterton on this one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
occasion, and again later to Galsworthy.</p>

<p>“I wish I could give you more interesting
reminiscences of Chesterton,
whose work I admire very much, but
we were of different generations and it
happened that we never met, though
we had many mutual friends. I think
my favorite book of his is ‘The Man
Who Was Thursday,’ which I remember
reading during my school days. I am
very pleased to hear from you that he
expressed admiration for ‘Goodbye Mr.
Chips.’ I did not know of this and it is
a source of deep gratification to me.”</p>

<p>Christopher Hollis first met G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.
in company with one of Belloc’s sons:</p>

<p>“The first time that I met Mr. Chesterton
was, when as an undergraduate
at Oxford, I was in the company of
Hilary Belloc, the son of Mr. Belloc, to
see the Association Football Cup Final—the
culminating event of the English
football season—at Wembley. We were
traveling by motor bicycle from Oxford
to Wembley and, passing through Beaconsfield
in the middle of the morning,
Hilary Belloc took me to pay a call on
Mr. Chesterton, whom we found walking
in the garden with his wife.”</p>

<p>And Hilaire Belloc himself:</p>

<p>“I met Mr. Chesterton first when I
was thirty, and he, I think, twenty-six.
That was at the end of the year 1900.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
I had already written and spoken for
some years on what later became known
as ‘Distributism.’ I do not think that
he had by that time written or spoken
upon public affairs.”</p>

<p>Gilbert Frankau is “afraid that I
only met G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton once. This
was at a debate. He took the chair
and was, I remember, a little sarcastic
about my own contribution. But the
sarcasm was so beautifully done that it
became almost a compliment. He
really had a rare charm of manner. And
he really was a character. Characters
being only too rare in this modern
world where all tend to become stereotyped.
I was, of course, a Father
Brown fan. But which really made the
deepest impression on my young mind
was Chesterton’s poetry. It had, for
me, the supreme virtue of vigor.”</p>

<p>The critic Coulson Kernahan admired
Chesterton hugely:</p>

<p>“The first time I met him was when
he was lunching with dear old Robert
Barr at the Savage Club. Barr came
over to my table to say ‘Chesterton is
my guest and I told him who you were.’
He said ‘Kernahan and I are two of
the rather uncommon authors, today,
who write of serious and religious subjects.
I’d like to meet him.’ ‘So come
over to my table, Kernahan, and meet
him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>“I did. At about two o’clock Barr
had to leave to keep an editorial engagement,
and I said to G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. ‘I am
a member. Won’t you stay on as my
guest now your host is going?’ He
did. He stayed till six o’clock, talking
brilliantly all the time (with an interlude
for tea—’till then he had enjoyed
the club’s excellent wine), and never
once repeated himself. Then we met
again at the Centenary Celebration of
George MacDonald. Ramsay MacDonald
was President of the Centenary
Memorial, with Chesterton and myself
as Vice-Presidents, and G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. was
one of the speakers, and very happy
and interesting in what he said.</p>

<p>“My last meeting with him was in
Hastings. My wife and I were passing
the Queen’s Hotel on the front, and I
heard myself hailed by name. It was
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. sitting outside in the sun at a
table, with a bottle of wine before him,
and he invited us to come and share it,
and as many more bottles as we felt inclined
for. Once again, he talked in
that brilliant paradoxical and ‘intriguing’
way of his and for hours on at a
time. My wife and I came away with
his musical, but rather high voice, still
in our ears, and with new and many
beautiful, but sometimes perplexing
thoughts, born of what that man of
genius had said, in our minds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>“That, alas, is all I can tell you of
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. But if you can get sight of
my book ‘Celebrities’ which I think
Dutton published in America, you will
find G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. figuring there as Judge,
(Bernard Shaw as Foreman and myself
as one of the Jury), at the much discussed
Edwin Drood trial held in the
June before the war by the Dickens Fellowship
of which I was, and still am,
a Vice-President. Chesterton, as I say
in my book, took the part of Judge seriously
and finely, for we wished to come
to some discovery about Edwin Drood.
But Bernard Shaw ‘guyed’ the show,
and turned a serious inquiry into a
farce.”</p>

<p>Eric Gill, the well known sculptor,
recalls,</p>

<p>“Apart from seeing Chesterton many
times at meetings I don’t think I actually
met him in a personal way until
about 1925 on the occasion of the
founding of ‘G.&nbsp;K.’s Weekly,’ when I
stayed the night at his house and we
discussed the policy of his paper, especially
with reference to industrialism
and art. After we came to live here
(which is only a few miles from Beaconsfield)
we saw him more often.”</p>

<p>A party of members of St. George’s
Rambling Society, devoted to historical
and archaeological research were visiting
Beaconsfield on a pleasant afternoon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
in the September of 1935. They
called upon the author at his home,
“Top Meadow.” Mrs. Chesterton received
them with much courtesy, and
while they were talking to her, he came
into the Lounge Hall of his house, which
was fitted up in the Tudor style, with
large fire-place, around which everyone
grouped. They rose when he entered,
and he soon engaged all in conversation.
He was in excellent form. His first
question, “What really did you come
here to see?” was promptly answered
by one of the members, Fred H. Postans,
“We came to see Mr. Chesterton.”
He then told an amusing anecdote
against himself. He had been much
annoyed by the noise made by the
local film studios quite close to his
home, and after sending several ineffectual
letters of protest, eventually
asked his secretary to call upon the
manager of the studios. Upon doing so,
that lady made a strong protest saying
emphatically, “The position is becoming
impossible.... Mr. Chesterton can’t
write,” to which the manager replied,
“We were well aware of that.” He
relished the telling of this story immensely.
He went on to give some
local details about Beaconsfield. It was
asked him whether he ever intended to
write a Life of Dr. Samuel Johnson,
and he said he thought that had already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
been done very well by Boswell.
Postans pointed out that there was a
little too much Boswell in that, in his
opinion. He seemed to agree and said
that he greatly admired the Doctor and
it was not entirely impossible that he
might undertake to write his life.</p>

<p>“My only meeting with Chesterton,”
writes Hugh Kingsmill, “was in the autumn
of 1912, when I went to Beaconsfield
to interview him for ‘Hearth and
Home,’ which was being edited by
Frank Harris. One of his arms was in a
sling, and he found great difficulty in
pouring out drink. To my surprise he
was not quaffing ale but sipping a
liqueur. He insisted however in pouring
the drinks for both of us, out of
courtesy. He seemed to me very absent-minded
and gentle, and I formed an
extremely pleasant impression of him.
At the same time he did not strike me
as at all alive to ordinary existence.
His praise of the man in the street and
of common life has always seemed to me
a defense thrown up against his own
temperament. I think he was naturally
an artist and poet of the self-absorbed,
rather limited kind, and that he was
afraid of this tendency, and fled to
democracy, Dickens and eventually the
Roman Church, in order not to lapse
into pure aestheticism. As far as I
know, and I have met many of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
his friends were drawn from rather
cranky people, not from normal types,
and this illustrates the division between
his opinions and his temperament. He
was not a good judge of individuals, in
my opinion. Nothing could be further
from the truth than his picture of
Dickens as a roistering lover of the
poor. On the other hand, his intelligence
was very acute in the destructive
criticism of the fads and poses against
which he was always contending. If
he did not understand ordinary life, he
certainly understood the aesthetes,
faddists and millenarians of the twenty
years before the war, and made brilliant
game of them in ‘Heretics.’ Since
the war, his work seems to me to have
fallen off greatly. I have seen him
several times, wandering about the
streets or in Marylebone station, and
was touched by his melancholy look. I
think life depressed him. In his youth
he praised the poor man’s literature of
thrillers and shockers. In his later life
he denounced the cinema. What the
distinction, at any rate in mind, between
printed nonsense and visible nonsense
is, he never explained. I attribute this
change of fact that as he grew older,
he could not summon up enough energy
to continue his celebration of the
man in the street, and was more concerned
with finding reasons for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
faith in his last refuge from a perplexing
world, the Roman Catholic Church.</p>

<p>“But he did a valuable work in destructive
criticism, and he was a lovable
figure. I cannot think of any other
well-known writer of the day in England
whom one would not sooner spare
from the scene than G.&nbsp;K. My friend
Hesketh Pearson was staying with me
when I read of Chesterton’s death. I
told him of it through the bathroom
door, and he sent up a hollow groan
which must have been echoed that
morning all over England.”</p>

<p>Philip Guedalla recollects, “I first
saw Gilbert Chesterton on the occasion
of a visit of his to Oxford when I was
an undergraduate ’round about 1909
or 1910. It was a dark vision of the
inside of a four-wheeled cab almost entirely
filled with Chesterton. From its
interior an arm and hand emerged and
proceeded to struggle wildly with the
outside handle of the vehicle. There
was a College debate the same evening
of which Chesterton was the opener;
and I was offered up to him as the only
undergraduate with insufficient impudence
to attempt this suicidal controversy.
He came back with me to my
room in College and performed two acts
which would have struck him as sacramentally
Chestertonian. First he sat
through my only arm chair to its destruction;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
then he finished all my
whisky. On the next morning I piously
presented for signature by its author a
copy of ‘Orthodoxy’ and was profoundly
shocked when he inscribed it ‘BOSH
BY G.&nbsp;K. CHESTERTON.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should be delighted to go on
record as one of the admirers of G.&nbsp;K.
Chesterton,” writes Clements Ripley.
“He has always been an enthusiasm of
mine. The first book of his I ever read
was ‘The Man Who Was Thursday.’ I
couldn’t have been more than fourteen
when I picked this up and of course a
great deal of the symbolism and the
metaphysical quality of the book escaped
me at that age. I read it for
the story and it was a very fast moving
and fascinating story. I think even
then I appreciated the brilliancy of
Chesterton’s paradoxical style, although
at that time I certainly wouldn’t have
called it that.”</p>

<p>“It seems hardly possible,” ponders
Walter de la Mare, “that a human being
with the least claim to a vestige of
intelligence should have forgotten his
first meeting with G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. I am, however,
that unfortunate kind of man, and
cannot even remember my first observations
on entering this (at least)
exceptionally interesting world. I recall
most vividly, of course, many meetings
and these memories are not in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
slightest degree composite ones—even
if memories ever are composite. And
so vividly, indeed, that it all but
amounts to an hallucination—as if we
were meeting again!</p>

<p>“Like how many, many friends of his,
I have the greatest affection for, and
admiration of, his work—and how much
his work was he himself, though not,
of course, all himself! That, I suppose,
can never be.”</p>

<p>“There is in London a distinguished
Society,” declares Marie Belloc Lowndes,
“called The Wiseman Dining Society.
As its name implies, it is a Catholic
Society, but no distinction is made with
regard to the religion of the speakers.
A great number of outstanding men
and women have delivered addresses on
every kind of subject of interest to an
educated man and woman. The net
thrown has been large, among those
who have spoken being people as different
as Lord Cecil (of the League of
Nations), Algernon Blackwood, the famous
novelist, Liddell Hart, the most
noted military critic in the English-speaking
world, and Bernard Pares, the
great authority on Russia. Of them
all, and the Society has been in existence
now for something like ten years—by
far the most interesting, and the
most beautifully delivered address, was
that of G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. on Joan of Arc. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
was the more remarkable, as to the
best of my belief, Chesterton was not
celebrated in this country as a speaker.
I myself never heard him speak in
public, but on that one occasion. No
reporters can be admitted to these dinners
because a very free discussion follows
every paper read, so I fear no record
of the speech exists.”</p>

<p>Father Owen F. Dudley records, “I
remember still quite vividly my first
meeting with Mr. Chesterton and having
tea with him in his house in Beaconsfield,
Bucks. He was tremendously
jovial over H.&nbsp;G. Wells, whom we discussed,
and whom he considered a
thinker who always stopped thinking.
As I watched him, I realized that all
the jokes that were bubbling out of him,
as well as the epigrams, would in all
probability appear in some article or
book. Mrs. Chesterton and the Secretary
were at tea and it struck me as
one of the cheeriest households I had
ever been in.”</p>

<p>No one believed more in these words
of his friend Hilaire Belloc than Chesterton
himself. He delighted in thousands
of steadfast friends and acquaintances,
and they rejoiced in his
inimitable wisdom and good fellowship.</p>

<p>The novelist, Isabel C. Clark, first met
him in 1929 when he and his wife
lunched with her at Piazza Grazioli: “I
cannot remember that he said anything
at all amusing or arresting, resembling
in this the late Lytton Strachey and
Kenneth Graham so that I imagine few
authors are as loquacious as myself.
But then I am not a man of genius!</p>

<p>“When I saw him he was fifty-five
years of age but looked at least ten
years more, probably on account of his
enormous bulk about which he was fond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
of joking; indeed I believe he was
proud of resembling Dr. Johnson in this
respect.</p>

<p>“I heard him lecture on Henry VIII
here at the Convent of the Holy Child
when he said that Henry had no intention
of Protestantizing the Church in
England but thought he could have a
Catholic Church with himself at the
head of it, and that he was astonished
to discover how rapidly it disintegrated
into many sects. I remember his saying
on this occasion: ‘Many people are
prejudiced against Henry VIII because
he was a Large Fat Man,’ and then
going off into a chuckle of laughter,
swelling himself out to an enormous
size as he spoke. His wife told me he
always rather spoilt his own jokes by
laughing at them before he uttered
them.”</p>

<p>Ralph Adams Cram met him first in
London a good many years ago: “Father
Wagget asked my wife and myself once
when we were staying in London, whom
we would like best to meet—‘anyone
from the King downward.’ We chose
Chesterton who was a very particular
friend of Father Wagget. At that time
we put on a dinner at the Buckingham
Palace Hotel (in those days the haunt
of all the County families) and in defiance
of fate, had this dinner in the
public dining room. We had as guests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
Father Wagget, G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. and Mrs. Chesterton.
The entrance into the dining
room of the short processional created
something of a sensation amongst the
aforesaid County families there assembled.
Father Wagget, thin, crop-headed
monk in cassock and rope;
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C., vast and practically globular;
little Mrs. Chesterton, very South Kensington
in moss green velvet; my wife,
and myself.</p>

<p>“The dinner was a riot. I have the
clearest recollection of G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. seated
ponderously at the table, drinking
champagne by magnums, continually
feeding his face with food which, as he
was constantly employed in the most
dazzling and epigrammatic conversation,
was apt to fall from his fork and
rebound from his corporosity, until the
fragments disappeared under the table.</p>

<p>“He and Father Wagget egged each
other on to the most preposterous
amusements. Each would write a
triolet for the other to illustrate. They
were both as clever with the pencil as
with the pen, and they covered the
backs of menus with most astonishing
literary and artistic productions. I particularly
remember G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. suddenly
looking out of the dining room window
towards Buckingham Palace and announcing
that he was now prepared ‘to
write a disloyal triolet.’ This was during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
the reign of King Edward VII, and
the result was convincing. I have somewhere
the whole collection of these literary
productions with their illustrations,
but where they are, I do not
know.”</p>

<p>“Ten or fifteen years ago,” recollects
Stephen Gwynn, whom we have already
quoted, “Barrie had taken a big house
for August, and there was a large party,
including several schoolboys and the
Chestertons. It was decided to play
the game of clues, and in the evening
a dozen or more of us were each given
bits of paper containing some mystification
in verse. At the end all the
clues led us to a most amusing charcoal
portrait of Lord Beaverbrook.
Everybody went to bed, and I was settling
down to a quiet chat with G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.
over whiskey and soda when three
schoolboys filed past. ‘Thank you very
much,’ they said to him, ‘for giving us
an amusing evening.’</p>

<p>“Next morning I said to the spokesman’s
mother, ‘Your youngster said his
piece very well.’ But she knew nothing
about it. It had been the schoolboy’s
own idea. Admittedly the Chestertons
were the best guests in that gathering
of a long and very mixed list.</p>

<p>“I remember how Lord David Cecil
when still a boy, sitting up there one
night and expounding to us two elders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
the point of view of the younger generation.
Not only the easiest man in
the world to talk with, but also a very
good listener.”</p>

<p>Lucille Borden, the novelist, found
G.&nbsp;K.’s personality was even more impressive
than the things he put to
paper: “I remember once on meeting
him I asked him what he thought of a
certain small English boy (who calls us
Aunt-Uncle though we are no relation)
who used to plot out London in sections,
selecting the men of prominence in
those sections, then call on them. This
between the ages of nine and thirteen.
He was very small and fragile, and by
reason of this, all flunkies and secretaries
let him pass. So he not only
gained access to the great man but
used to go and sit with him, looking for
all the world like Tiny Tim.</p>

<p>“‘Indeed I remember that boy—he
was an extraordinary chap. He will go
far but he needs a guiding hand.’ ...
This after the boy had grown. The
thing that was so remarkable was, that
Terence had only his inquisitive personality
to recommend him. He has
gone far but without the guiding hand,
and drifted into the set pseudo-literati,
sponsored by the Sitwells. However, at
the age of eighteen or nineteen he married—a
very clever young woman over
whom the London newspapers fought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
and whom the “Daily Mail” finally acquired—as
one of their top-notch women.
This gives Terry leisure to write
terrible but correct poetry—and to
carry on a most extraordinary and original
literary career.</p>

<p>“Back to ‘nos moutons’—we’ve seen
Gilbert Chesterton start a broadcast-speech
to a club on whose Board I am—for
which he was allowed forty minutes:
He rose from the speakers’ table—put
his watch in front of him—began
one of the most stirring prose poems to
which we all ever listened—made his
introduction—points in phrases as colorful
as a rainbow—approached his conclusion—made
his logical deductions
and finished on the fortieth minute. It
was such a tour de force as was rarely
done in the earliest days of radio.”</p>

<p>“When I was introduced to Chesterton,”
writes Adolphe de Castro, “I was
a bit abashed. He was so formidable
and such a mighty eater. But his conversation
and his wit were delightful.
I have my doubts if any one ever had
the temerity to ask Mr. Chesterton
why he had embraced Catholicism. I
asked him. Americans in those days
were forgiven much, and a friend of the
late Ambrose Bierce was a particularly
privileged character. Chesterton twirled
the end of his scraggly moustache for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
some time, then he said: ‘Because of its
primitivity.’</p>

<p>“‘Then you ought to have become a
Jew,’ I said. ‘Judaism has greater
primitivity.’</p>

<p>“To which he rejoined: ‘It has too
much primitivity and is not sufficiently
elastic for adaptability.’</p>

<p>“‘You hold with Heine that Judaism
is not a religion but a misfortune?’ I
asked.</p>

<p>“‘Heine was a great poet,’ returned
Chesterton. ‘And do you recall what
John Locke said, ‘A merchant lies for
gain; a poet lies for pleasure.’ Do you
happen to write poetry?’</p>

<p>“I put my hand in my pocket and
pulled out a sheaf of papers, extracted
one and gave it to him. He read it.
‘I like this,’ he said.</p>

<p>“It was a quasi sonnet entitled ‘The
Jewish Poet.’”</p>

<p>“At one time I doubted the existence
of G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.,” declares Holbrook Jackson.
“I listened to the stories of him as one
listens to the yarns of men who have
been in the ends of the earth. And
even now, after I have looked upon him
with my own eyes, I have to nudge
myself to realize his probability. He
has the reality of one of those dragons
or fairies in which he has such invincible
faith. I first beheld him on a Yorkshire
moor far from his natural element,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
which is in London. He was in
the locality on a holiday, and I had gone
over to verify his existence just as one
might go to the Arctic regions to verify
the existence of the North Pole or the
Northwest Passage.</p>

<p>“He was staying at the house of a
Bradford merchant adjoining the moor,
and I was to meet him there. It was
April and raining. I trudged through
the damp furze and heather up to the
house only to find that the object of
my pilgrimage had disappeared without
leaving a trace behind him. No alarm
was felt, as that was one of his habits.
Sometimes he would go down to the
railway station, and taking a ticket to
any place that had a name which appealed
to him, vanish into the unknown,
making his way home on foot or wheel
as fancy or circumstances directed. On
this occasion, however, nothing so serious
had happened. Therefore I adjourned
with the lady of the house and
Mrs. Chesterton to an upper hall, where
a noble latticed window commanded a
wide vista of the moor. I peered into
the wild, half hoping that I should first
behold the great form of Gilbert Chesterton
looming over the bare brow of
the wold, silhouetted against the grey
sky like the symbol of a large new faith.</p>

<p>“His coming was not melodramatic;
it was, on the contrary, quite simple,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
quite idyllic, and quite characteristic.
In fact, he did not come at all, rather
was it that our eyes, and later our
herald, went to him. For quite close to
the house we espied him, hatless and
negligently clad in a Norfolk suit of
homespun, leaning in the rain against a
budding tree, absorbed in the pages of
a little red book.</p>

<p>“This was a most fitting vision. It
suited admirably his unaffected, careless,
and altogether childlike genius. He
came into the house shortly afterwards
and consumed tea and cake like any
mortal and talked the talk of Olympus
with the abandonment and irresistibility
of a child. I found his largeness
wonderfully proportionate, even, as is
so rarely the case with massive men,
to his head. This is amply in keeping
with the rest of his person. He wears
a tangled mass of light brown hair prematurely
streaked with grey, and a
slight moustache. His grey-blue eyes
laugh happily as his full lips unload
themselves of a constant flow of self-amused
and piquant words. Like Dr.
Johnson whom he resembles so much in
form, he is a great talker. But while
I looked at him I was not reminded of
the lexicographer, but of Balzac. And
as his monologue rolled on and we
laughed and wondered, I found myself
carried away to a studio in France,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
where the head of Chesterton became
one with the head of Rodin’s conception
of France’s greatest literary genius.</p>

<p>“Since my first meeting I have seen
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. many times. I have seen him
standing upon platforms defending the
people’s pleasures against the inroads
of Puritanism. I have seen him addressing
men from a pulpit, and on one
memorable occasion at Clifford’s Inn
Hall I saw him defending the probability
of the liquefication of the blood of
St. Januarius in the teeth of a pyrotechnic
heckling from Bernard Shaw.
Again I have seen his vast person dominating
the staring throng in Fleet
Street like a superman; and I have seen
the traffic of Ludgate Circus held up
for him, as he strolled by in cloak and
sombrero like a brigand of Adelphi
drama or a Spanish hidalgo by Velasquez,
oblivious alike of critical bus-driver
and wonder-struck multitude.</p>

<p>“But best it is to see him in his
favorite habitat of Bohemian Soho.
There in certain obscure yet excellent
French restaurants with Hilaire Belloc
and other writers and talkers, he may
be seen, sitting behind a tall tankard
of lager or a flagon of Chianti, eternally
unravelling the mysterious tangle of
living ideas; now rising mountainously
on his feet to overshadow the company
with weighty argument, anon brandishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
a wine bottle as he insists upon defending
some controversial point until
‘we break the furniture’; and always
chuckling at his own wit and the sallies
of others, as he fights the battle of
ideas with indefatigable and unconquerable
good-humour.”</p>

<span class="subhead">ON THE ENGLISH PLATFORM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the course of his life, Chesterton
accomplished much lecturing and public
speaking as did most of the English
writers of his generation such as Shaw,
Wells, and to a lesser extent Galsworthy
and Bennett. Like many Englishmen
his success as a speaker was
variable and subject to his health and
feelings even more than most men. Yet
no matter how indifferently Chesterton
might have done in the formal part of
his address, he always more than redeemed
himself in the question-and-answer
period that followed. The speed
with which he would answer questions
was simply incredible. As one listened
to him answering one question after
another usually of so unrelated a nature,
one marvelled at ability and nimbleness
so extraordinary.</p>

<p>The distinguished author R. Ellis
Roberts, heard a lecture at Oxford:</p>

<p>“I do not, alas! remember what Mr.
Chesterton lectured to us about. I remember
the manner of his lecture. It
seemed to be written on a hundred written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
pieces of variously shaped paper,
written in ink and pencils (of all colors
and in chalk). All the papers were in
a splendid and startling disorder, and
I remember being at first just a little
disappointed. Then the papers were
abandoned, and G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. talked, and we
got more and more interested and
pleased. I remember a passage about
cathedrals and railway stations which
aroused opposition; and with opposition
and question the real Chesterton
broke loose. He will, I am sure, if he
reads this in the next world, forgive
me for saying that to myself I whispered
‘Elephant’. All day the image
had been present with me of something
vast and weighty, incredibly simple,
incalculably wise, and unquestionably
kindly. Foolishly I mourned a certain
sluggishness. Then as I say, came opposition;
and suddenly—trunk up, roaring,
speeding, faster and faster—the
wisest of us was pursuing his trifling
opponents through quickset hedge and
over ploughed fields of argument. How
he raced! I know, because of all the
opposition none ran faster than I!”</p>

<p>“My own acquaintance with Chesterton,”
Father Francis J. Yealy, S.&nbsp;J.,
writes “has been gained from his books
and from one of his lectures delivered
in Cambridge, England, in 1925. Just
outside the town of Cambridge is a village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
called Chesterton, the Anglican
vicar of which sat on the stage during
the lecture. Afterwards he made a short
speech, inviting G.&nbsp;K. to visit the village
and, I believe, suggesting that it
might have been named after his ancestors.
At any rate Chesterton responded
gracefully and played most
amusingly with this identity of names.
It was possible, he said, that the place
had been named after one of his ancestors,
but it seemed more likely that
the family had taken their name from
it. Perhaps they had lived there in the
remote past under a different name,
and one of them, who would no doubt
have been a worthless fellow, had eventually
been run out of town. The natural
place to go was of course Cambridge;
and the people there with their great
kindliness allowed him to loiter about.
In time he became a familiar figure in
Cambridge; but, as no one knew his
name, they began to refer to him as the
fellow from Chesterton and later simply
as Chesterton. This he thought was
very reasonable theory of the origin of
his name.”</p>

<p>“One day in February, 1902,” records
Mr. Karl H. Harklander, “I happened
to notice on the announcing board of
the Leeds University that a G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton
would lecture about ‘Man, Great
Man, Super-man.’ I was a young textile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
manufacturer on a business journey
and hungered for more than ‘bread
alone!’ That night I heard the best
and also the shortest lecture of my
life; in less than twenty minutes our
assembly was quite clear about ‘Man,
Great man, Super-man.’ I marked my
young ‘man’ who might become super-man,’
but who chose to be ‘great man’
in accordance with the exposition of the
1902 lecture.”</p>

<p>A charming reminiscence comes from
Edward Brown:</p>

<p>“In 1927 the great man accepted the
Honorary Presidency of the University
College of Wales (Aberystwyth) Debates
Union. The undergraduates resolved
that he should be conveyed from
the station to the Queen’s Hotel in a
manner worthy of his greatness and
of our reputation for hospitality. An
old fashioned vehicle of the ‘growler’
variety was dug out from the lumber
yard of an inn and some of the dust and
signs of neglect were removed therefrom.</p>

<p>“As Secretary of Debates Union I
demanded and won, the privilege of
driving this state coach. Our Officers
Training Corps received permission to
act as escort but were refused the privilege
of carrying arms. They accordingly
armed themselves with hoes,
rakes, spades, axes, etcetera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>“It had been arranged that the President
of the Union should sit with
Chesterton (‘back to the engine’) and
the President of Ladies’ Hostel ...
fortunately a very small lady ... with
Mrs. Chesterton. But as soon as the
two guests had taken their seats, the
O.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;C. rushed the coach and some half
dozen of them secured a seat or footing
of some sort. A burly sergeant with
battle axe (borrowed from the Art Department)
sat beside Mrs. Chesterton
facing G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. My stolid steeds were
replaced by forty undergraduates, and
we tore through the narrow streets at
a most reckless pace.”</p>

<p>In reply to the demand for a speech,
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. stood at the top of Queen’s
Hotel steps and said,</p>

<p>“You need never be ashamed of the
athletic prowess of this College. The
Pyramids, we are told, were built by
slave labor. But the slaves were not
expected to haul the pyramids in one
piece!”</p>

<p>In his address that evening he commented
on the ancient custom of sending
a condemned man to his death in
the same coach as the executioner; and
described his feelings as he faced the
great axe in the coach. Later he presented
the “executioner” with an exquisite
caricature of them both with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
axe between them. The caricature now
hangs in the Men’s Union.</p>

<p>An Honorary President of the Debate
Union at Aberystwyth is always elected
by the D.&nbsp;U. Committee (all students,
save for one Lecturer). The name is
submitted to the Senate for its approval.
The Debate Union was formed
from an amalgamation of the Literary
and Debating Society and the Political
Union in 1925 about a year before
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.’s Presidency. Chesterton was
succeeded by John Drinkwater, John
van Druten, and Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch.</p>

<p>G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.’s speech was on “Liberty:
the Last Phase,” by which he explained
he meant the <em>latest</em> phase. Just
as barons had fought against the tyranny
of would-be despots, just as yeoman
had fought those same barons for
freedom of property and action, just as
... etc. factory-hands; electors ... so
ought men today to band in a great
crusade to defend the common man’s
freedom of the highway, a freedom
which was being denied him by the
motorist. The cause was obscured by
the common man’s desire to join the
enemy as soon as his means permitted
him to do so. Envy of our enemy inspired
a desire to emulate him. His
chariots were objects of admiration,
instead of loathing and furious hostility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
... But the fact remained that our
roads, our ancient highways were being
wrested from us. “The price of liberty
is eternal vigilance.”</p>

<p>The Senior History Lecturer and
some others were of the opinion that
the whole thesis of the address was a
gigantic leg-pull!</p>

<p>The students that evening were a
songful crowd, and they had evolved in
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.’s honour a parody of a well-known
Salvation Army hymn that went,
“I’m H-A-P-P-PY, I know I am, I’m
sure I am, I’m H-A-P-P-Y!”</p>

<p>They had already several parodies on
that spelling motif, such as “I’m
D-R-U-N-K!”</p>

<p>That evening as G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. entered,
they all burst into, “I’m G.&nbsp;K. Chester—TON,”
with terrific and increasing emphasis
on the TON, later varying it
“G.&nbsp;K.... Just-a TON.” The great
man was delighted and bowed, smiled,
and clapped his hands.</p>

<p>Of Chesterton in Liverpool Mr. Clarence
Fry recalls, “I was living in Liverpool
at the time Mr. Chesterton joined
the Roman Catholic Church. Having
been charmed with his writings, I went
to see and hear him lecture. I remember
how disappointed I was with his
address (perhaps owing to Protestant
prejudices). But I had reckoned without
my host. The Chairman said all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
questions asked on paper would be
answered by the Speaker. And then
Mr. Chesterton rose and reading out
each question, replied in a few pregnant
words; immediately sitting down and
beaming most angelically all round the
hall on the audience, as much as to say,
‘How’s that! Beat that, if you can!’
And in <em>no</em> one case could any answer be
ventured. I was delighted and overwhelmed
with the sense of his masterly
dealing with the issues laid before him.
The replies were electric in their concise
power. Also, as you may believe, I
was charmed with his whole personality.”</p>

<p>The chairman was the late Roman
Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool, Dr.
Keating, supported by the Catholic
Bishop of Birmingham and other dignitaries.
The occasion aroused great
interest, as not long before G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. had
joined the Catholic Church. The meeting
was arranged so that this new “Defender
of the Faith” might help the
cause of Catholicism in the city. The
speech was largely devoted to an exposition
of his newly-found faith.</p>

<p>“Chesterton seldom came to Glasgow,”
records George Mortimer, “and
the only time I heard him was on his
first visit to the city one Sunday evening
fully thirty years ago when he lectured
in the Berkeley Hall which seats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
about six hundred people. His subject
was ‘Some New Dangers of Oligarchies.’
In those days Sunday evening
lectures were not popular in Scotland,
and neither are they now. The churches
are in most cases meagrely attended in
the evening, the majority of people
either going for a walk, visiting their
friends or remaining at home and listening
to the wireless.</p>

<p>“Evidently G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton, whom
I had first seen referred to years previously
as a new Carlyle, proved a powerful
magnet, for instead of going to
church I traveled from Paisley to Glasgow—seven
miles by tramcar. All I
remember about the meeting is that the
hall was well filled; that a Scottish author,
David Lowe, at present contributing
reminiscences which he calls ‘Lowe
Life’ to a Glasgow paper, was chairman;
that Chesterton, then thirty years
of age, was a large and fleshy man with
a fine head of luxuriant brown hair;
and that he made reference to the Boer
War, to Lord Rosebery, and to Mr.
Parks, a prominent lawyer, business
man, Methodist and Liberal M.&nbsp;P., I
have a general impression that he
showed himself a democrat.”</p>

<p>“Chesterton was a past master of the
art known popularly as ‘pulling your
leg,’” according to Mr. William Platt.
“With him, this was not merely a manifestation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
of his exuberant temperament;
it was also a matter of principle,
a determination to make the other man
see that there are two sides to every
question.</p>

<p>“I remember well his address to the
British Humanitarian League. This
body was of excellent principles, and
supported by many and able and eminent
persons; but it also contained many
who had become rabid and fanatical,
and so provided targets, for G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>“‘If’ he said ‘you ask me to extend
my sympathy to the poor fox, pursued
by savage sportsmen, shall I not also
extend it to the poor sportsman, pursued
by savage humanitarians?’</p>

<p>“And he proceeded to draw a contrast
between the typical elderly colonel, who
ought by profession to be a man of
blood, but who in point of fact was the
kindest and mildest of men, and the
typical humanitarian, who ought to be
brimming over with human kindness,
but who on the contrary was furiously
ready to assail any unfortunate who
happened in his or her opinion to transgress
the code.</p>

<p>“Bernard Shaw was present, and during
the debate received a delicious setback
from a witty Irishman called
Connel. ‘Shaw is out to persuade us to
be vegetarians,’ he said; ‘but if we all
adopt that creed, what would happen?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
Rabbits would obey the Scriptural command
to increase and multiply until
they overran the whole country-side
and ate up every vegetable; and where
then would Mr. Bernard Shaw get his
daily bunch of carrots?’</p>

<p>“Despite Chesterton’s ability to state
the other side, and to state it wittily
and well, he was no mere arguer for
argument’s sake. He would not put
forward any viewpoint unless he was
convinced that there was ground for his
support. He hated that type of politician
or publicist who from sheer intellectual
dexterity could argue in favor
of any cause that it paid him to support,
probably with his tongue in his
cheek. This is very clearly seen in his
brilliant retort to Lord Birkenhead,
ending with that overwhelming:—‘Chuck
it, Smith!’</p>

<p>“Probably the finest instance of the
effective use of slang by a great literary
stylist!</p>

<p>“When he spoke to me about my
work he used to <span class="locked">say:—</span></p>

<p>“‘What I admire about your idealism,
as shown in your writings, is the fact
that I know it to be genuine. For
writers who merely pay lip-service to
ideals, because they think it safest to
do so, I have no use whatever. But I
know that what you say, you mean.’</p>

<p>“Chesterton, like most artistic persons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
had a dislike for officialdom and
bureaucracy. It seems so often to lead
to a dull and spurious uniformity and
standardization. The natural love of
the artist is for variety, reaching out
to a fullness of life and experience.</p>

<p>“I remember hearing G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. make
a very amusing point at a meeting of
educationists where he was the chief
speaker. He pictured a state of things
where the official director of education
might be a man with chronic catarrh.
Far from realizing this as a deficiency,
the official, he supposed, would attempt
to impose it on others; to require that
all pupils should be told to pronounce
English as the director pronounced it.
Or, as Chesterton amusingly put <span class="locked">it:—</span></p>

<p>“‘He wadted theb do brodoudce Idglish
as he hibself brodoudced it, this
bad with the groddig gattarrh. Ibadgidge
it for yourselves.’</p>

<p>“To those who never heard G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.
speak in public I would say that he
stood on the platform as the very essence
of good humour. He beamed on
all and sundry. He radiated kindliness.
He smiled, he laughed, he bubbled over.
He was out to enjoy himself and to
make every one present enjoy himself.
A personification of mirth, good temper
and happy humanity.”</p>

<p>“Prof. A.&nbsp;J. Armstrong, head of the
English Department of Baylor University,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
Waco, Texas, heard G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. in
England,</p>

<p>“He talked to the members of my
group for more than an hour on Browning.
He referred to his own life of
Browning as an immature work, although
he said it was necessary for him
to do a great deal of hack work when
he was young, about the time of this
publication.</p>

<p>“When one of the ladies present interrupted
and said,</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Chesterton, the Browning work
has some wonderful things in it,’ he
only laughed and went on. In his
thoughts he stayed close to the things
that he had said in his book. His general
conversation, of course, was delightful
and was filled with the paradoxes
for which he was so famous.</p>

<p>“He took dinner with us at the Hotel
Victoria, off Trafalgar Square, and Mrs.
Chesterton was with him. I sat next
Mrs. Chesterton the whole evening and
she was a lovely woman, quiet, refined,
a poetess, with a great many experiences
which she told delightfully.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chesterton had a delightful wit,
was a vigorous speaker, and was a man
of great power,—although—and I believe
that this is not given with what
one usually knows of him—he had a
shy way of looking under his glasses
that was charming.</p>

<p>“A little later we had our symposium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
in London where Mr. Chesterton addressed
a group of friends. I do not
know whether you ever heard of Mrs.
French-Sheldon or not. Before her
death all the “Who’s Who” carried her.
She was an American who learned her
‘A B C’s’ from Washington Irving, and
from that time until her death her life
was one long spectacle. She told me
that at one time she was the guest of
George Sand, and that Chopin came in,
and Victor Hugo later joined them.
Just imagine such a coterie!</p>

<p>“Mrs. French-Sheldon was one who
did a great deal of exploring in Africa,
and was the first white woman to enter
one side of the African Continent and
come out on the other. Later under the
direction of J.&nbsp;B. Pond, she made
twenty-three addresses in America and
received $23,000 in cash for them, that
is, one thousand dollars a night.</p>

<p>“When I was interested in getting
Mr. Chesterton to speak in Waco his fee
was one thousand dollars. So in London
when I introduced Mrs. French-Sheldon
in the charming coterie, I said
to Mr. Chesterton: ‘Probably when you
were a little boy in short trousers this
lady was touring American cities at one
thousand dollars a night, so you can
see that you are not the only one that
gets that price, and she got it twenty
years before you did.’ Mr. Chesterton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
answered with a smile. But he seemed
tremendously impressed, for in the social
hour that followed the symposium,
he showed Mrs. French-Sheldon a number
of courtesies.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lillian Curt heard a lecture in
London,</p>

<p>“His large body was rather picturesque,
but one received a shock when a
tiny, high pitched voice emanated from
it. I well remember on one occasion
before the War that G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. was asked
to speak in the large Town Hall of Battersea.
The occasion was the Annual
Soiree of the West Lambeth Association
of Teachers—a large and important
local gathering of learned folk and their
friends. G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. then in his prime,
was the lion of the evening and the
lion was expected to roar when his turn
came. But no, G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. stood, like a
huge cherub, emitting little squeaky
phrases. The teachers huddled closer
together and craned their necks forward.
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. went on unconcernedly
and those who could hear, heard gems
of the first (literally) water pour from
those curved lips. Not that one sentence
had much to do with the last, but each
was a superb thought complete in itself
and miraculously moulded. I was there,
so I know—and enjoyed a delightful
tete-a-tete with him and his charming
wife afterwards. He was in strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
contrast with his brother Cecil—a little
man, wee-proportioned, with a charming
literary style and good lecture-voice,
who fell in the Great European
war.”</p>

<p>In 1928 Chesterton spoke before the
Summer Course at the Victoria and
Albert Museum. Mr. Charles A. Eva
recalls that it was a sweltering hot
July day, and when Chesterton turned
up late owing to a train delay, he began
his discourse by remarking,</p>

<p>“This is no sort of weather for lecturing
or listening, as the lecturer on this
occasion can rely on the weather, and
not on himself, to send the audience to
sleep.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_SIX">CHAPTER SIX<br>

<span class="subhead">ON THE AMERICAN PLATFORM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Chesterton made two extended visits
to the United States, in 1920–1, and in
1930–1. Both times he traversed the
length and breadth of the country, delivering
innumerable lectures, making
many addresses, and participating in
not a few debates. No matter what
the occasion he never forgot his sense
of humor. At the Soldiers’ Memorial
Hall, Pittsburgh, he was introduced to
a large audience by Bishop Hugh C.
Boyle. When G.&nbsp;K. stood up there arose
a collective audible gasp at the enormous
size of the man making his way
to the amplifier. His opening words
were,</p>

<p>“At the outset I want to reassure you
I am not this size, really; dear no, I’m
being amplified by the thing.”</p>

<p>He debated with Cosmo Hamilton
at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on
November 26th, 1930. The subject of
debate was presumably unknown to
the two authors, and was announced by
the Chairman William C. Redfield, Secretary
of Commerce under Wilson, “Is
Immorality in the Novel Justified.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
The audience was composed chiefly of
educators, priests, college instructors,
and grade teachers; all seemed properly
pleased by the title of the evening’s
discourse, and settled back to enjoy the
action ... Chesterton annihilating
his gracious and graceful opponent.
They were not denied. Chesterton
scored decidedly when he showed that
what is moral is justified, and that the
contrary, of course, could never be
justified.</p>

<p>This Chesterton explained in his introductory
remarks, which he took
from written notes, as Hamilton also
did when he arose. Apparently they
were formulated, and used in more than
one debate in their tour. Chesterton
charmingly denied he was there to
make a football of Hamilton, who had
protested such, but that he was rather
a football in appearance, even if on the
side of the angels, and Hamilton more
the lithe athlete. After these amenities,
Chesterton divided his argument into
three sections: immorality in the novel
violates ... first, good morals; second,
good manners; third, good taste.</p>

<p>“You can’t discuss inflaming the passions
without doing it,” Chesterton
pointed out. In reply to a query from
Hamilton, “On the contrary, I like and
admire very much the works of Aldous
Huxley, but, (here he showed genuine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
anger) as for that weak, sniveling,
dirty, pacifistic Enrique Maria Remarque,
I have nothing but contempt.”</p>

<p>Chesterton made many notes, chuckling
to himself as he scribbled something
soon to come forth as a sally, pausing
now and then to survey the audience or
his opponent, and again interrupting
his writing to place his pencil between
his teeth to applaud some remark of
Hamilton’s.</p>

<p>“Chesterton’s voice was a fairly high
tenor,” recalls Mr. Daniel Kern who
was present, “not at all surprising. I
have observed that many Englishmen
despite bulk and great size, possess the
same type voice. For example, H.&nbsp;G.
Wells’ ... so high and snuffled that it
was execrable coming over the radio.
The loud-speaker system made it easy
to hear both men. Both speakers were
making use of a word which sounded
like ‘eppitet’ or ‘epithet,’ which in the
context could have had no meaning.
The people about us were confused. As
we became used to their voices, it developed
that the word was ‘appetite.’
You can estimate the frequency of the
occurrence of this word in an ethical
discussion when it is coupled with the
modifiers ‘innate’ and ‘acquired’.”</p>

<p>G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.’s pink face, framed by a
white mane of hair, isolated by a
rumpled dinner jacket, shining beautifully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
at the audience, caused Kern’s
companion, a singular personality, to
remark wistfully, “Chesterton’s just a
saint, just a saint.”</p>

<p>The warm, human, simple childlike
nature, and the beaming benevolence of
Chesterton’s smile was so utterly
charming that Mr. W.&nbsp;D. Hennessy also
present, was immediately reminded of
two quite disparate characters his “favorite
uncle, now deceased and Santa
Claus. As I thought more about it, I
realized that my first instinctive impression
in its childlike simplicity, was
founded upon a correct perception. My
uncle was loved by every man, woman,
child, and dog in his town and he was
the most natural democrat I ever knew.
I am just as certain that Chesterton
was a beloved figure to his neighbors
and that he was a true democrat in
the best sense of that much abused
term.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hamilton several times referred
to Chesterton as a cherub and a teacher.
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. expressed difficulty in reconciling
the picture of a cherub and a
teacher, but I think Cosmo Hamilton’s
appellations were apt, for was not Chesterton
an angelic teacher? And when a
casual remark about the New York
subway was made by Hamilton, I was
delighted at the way G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. pounced
upon it as a perfect allegory, comparing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
the modern world looking for its way
with the stranger lost in the labyrinths
of the subway.”</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph J. Reilly attended a debate
at Mecca Temple in New York
City, between Chesterton and Clarence
Darrow, which dealt with the story of
creation as presented in Genesis. It
was a Sunday afternoon and the Temple
was packed. At the conclusion of the
debate everybody was asked to express
his opinion as to the victor and slips of
paper were passed around for that purpose.
The award went directly to Chesterton.
Darrow in comparison, seemed
heavy, uninspired, slow of mind, while
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. was joyous, sparkling and
witty ... quite the Chesterton one had
come to expect from his books. The
affair was like a race between a lumbering
sailing vessel and a modern steamer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Frances Taylor Patterson also
heard the Chesterton-Darrow debate,
but went to the meeting with some
misgivings because she was a trifle
afraid that Chesterton’s “gifts might
seem somewhat literary in comparison
with the trained scientific mind and
rapier tongue of the famous trial lawyer.
Instead, the trained scientific
mind, the clear thinking, the lightning
quickness in getting a point and hurling
back an answer, turned out to belong
to Chesterton. I have never heard Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
Darrow alone, but taken relatively,
when that relativity is to Chesterton,
he appears positively muddle-headed.”</p>

<p>Although the terms of the debate
were determined at the outset, Darrow
either could not or would not stick to
the definitions, but kept going off at
illogical tangents and becoming choleric
over points that were not in dispute.
He seemed to have an idea that all religion
was a matter of accepting Jonah’s
whale as a sort of luxury-liner. As
Chesterton summed it up, he felt as if
Darrow had been arguing all afternoon
with his fundamentalist aunt, and the
latter kept sparring with a dummy of
his own mental making. When something
went wrong with the microphone,
Darrow sat back until it could be fixed.
Whereupon G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. jumped up and
carried on in his natural voice, “Science
you see is not infallible!” Whatever
brilliance Darrow had in his own right,
it was completely eclipsed. For all the
luster that he shed, he might have been
a remote star at high noon drowned by
the bright incandescent arc light of the
sun. Chesterton had the audience with
him from the start, and when it was
over, everyone just sat there, not wishing
to leave. They were loath to let
the light die!</p>

<p>Clarence Darrow wrote the author
shortly before his death,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>“I was favorably impressed by,
warmly attached to, G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton.
I enjoyed my debates with him, and
found him a man of culture and fine
sensibilities. If he and I had lived
where we could have become better acquainted,
eventually we would have
ceased to debate, I firmly believe.”</p>

<p>Bishop George Craig Stewart of Chicago,
presided at Orchestra Hall when
Chesterton debated in that city with
Dr. Horace J. Bridges of the Ethical
Cultural Society on the subject, “Is
Psychology a Curse?” In his closing
remarks Chesterton devastatingly sideswiped
his opponent and wound up the
occasion in a storm of laughter and
applause,</p>

<p>“It is clear that I have won the debate,
and we are all prepared to acknowledge
that psychology is a curse.
Let us, however, be magnanimous. Let
us allow at least one person in this unhappy
world to practice this cursed
psychology, and I should like to nominate
Dr. Bridges.”</p>

<p>During Dr. Bridges’ share of the debate
Chesterton was drawing funny pictures
on the back of a torn envelope
which he produced out of his capacious
inner pocket. At the close of the debate,
Bishop Stewart begged the torn
envelope with the funny pictures,
which the artist initialed “From G.&nbsp;K.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
C. to G.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;S.” It now hangs framed
with one of G.&nbsp;K.’s photographs in the
episcopal drawingroom.</p>

<p>At luncheon Bishop Stewart remarked,
“Mr. Chesterton, <em lang="la">securus judicat orbis
terrarum</em>. You have become a Roman
Catholic, and I do not doubt that you
have gained the whole world, but may I
suggest that one may gain the whole
world and lose one’s soul, and I think
you have lost the soul of Chestertonianism,
for after all, when you were an
Anglican you were both a Protestant
and a Catholic, and that was a delightfully
Chestertonian position. Now you
have become a Romanist, you have
ceased to be a Chestertonian.”</p>

<p>Chesterton’s only response to this
Anglican leg pulling was a beaming and
chuckling acknowledgment of the
charge.</p>

<p>At the luncheon Chesterton talked
just as he wrote, on any subject that
came up, in a free, flowing, brilliant
manner, and everything he said might
have been taken down and published as
a part of his weekly letter to the
“Illustrated London News.”</p>

<p>In introducing Chesterton for the debate,
Bishop Stewart had quoted Oliver
Hereford’s delightful verse,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“When plain folks such as you and I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">See the sun sinking in the sky,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">How fine the sunrise is tonight!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the lecture was over, Chesterton
strode down the aisle towards the
main entrance where Mr. Edward Cassidy
was standing with his wife who
wished to get his autograph on a
book. Suddenly a very important looking
lorgnetted dowager accompanied by
her daughter confronted the massive
man.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chesterton,” she demanded,
“might I ask when did you become famous?”</p>

<p>“I became famous, if you can call it
that,” the great author chuckled, “at a
time when there were no famous men
in England.”</p>

<p>He went on to explain that there had
been no very great writers or journalists
in England during the Boer War.
His bitter opposition to the war ran so
counter to the English press of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
period that he became famous for his
disloyalty, and for refusing to run with
the crowd.</p>

<p>Chesterton impressed the late Reverend
Frederic Seidenberg, S.&nbsp;J., who
was also present in Orchestra Hall, as
a man one could never forget, “not only
his huge size, but his striking personality
and ever present smile are things
that one would carry through life. We
had a full house, but his voice was so
thin that I immediately had the speaker’s
desk placed at the edge of the footlights.
When he began again to speak
several in the balcony called out,
‘Louder!’ After a moment’s hesitation,
Chesterton looked up and said, ‘Good
brother, don’t worry, you’re not missing
a thing.’ The audience roared.”</p>

<p>Dr. Horace J. Bridges has kindly
given his impressions,</p>

<p>“I had two public debates with Chesterton,
one in Chicago and one in Milwaukee.
He struck me as a curious
mixture of great personal charm, wide
reading, exquisite critical faculty
(manifested particularly in his interpretations
of Browning and of Dickens),
delightful humor, and a certain intellectual
recklessness that made him indifferent
to truth and reality. I cannot
but feel that fundamentally—perhaps
I should say subconsciously—he
was a thorough-going skeptic and acted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
upon the principle that, since we cannot
really be positive about anything,
we had better believe what it pleases
us to believe. I think he never did
justice to the real arguments for a case
he opposed; and he had a slap-dash way
of assuming that the weaknesses in an
opponent’s case proved not only the
falsity of that case, but—which is obviously
a very different matter—the
truth of his own case.</p>

<p>“One may think my criticism of him
unfair. I certainly do not mean it to be
so, nor do I fail to recognize that men
much more earnest in their truth-seeking
than he was have sincerely believed
the things he said he believed. My
comment is on his mental processes, in
distinction from the question of his particular
beliefs.”</p>

<p>Chesterton spoke in St. Louis at the
Odeon Theatre. On the stage his entire
appearance was distinctive: shaggy,
tousled dark-light hair topped a massive
head and full, ruddy face; eyes
which seemed always half-closed were
protected by thick-lensed glasses;
heavy shoulders and ponderous girth
bulked above long, slender legs. Over
evening dress he wore a black cape;
when he doffed it and stood ready
to speak, his stiff, white shirt-front became
awry and crept several degrees
out of proper position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>“A gentle giant Chesterton seemed,”
recalls Mr. James O’Neill, “as he commenced
to address his audience. His
high-pitched voice sounded somewhat
of a plaintive and apologetic note.”</p>

<p>Lamenting the pseudo-sophistication
of the day and the loss of appreciation
for the simple pleasures of yore, Chesterton
complained that the modern man
and woman were seeking to escape
ennui by finding new thrills, which
tendency was expressed in our entertainments
and even in our foods.
Whereas we had once been satisfied
with the taste of one palatable comestible
at a time, we now demanded a combination
of several in such an assembly
as the modern three-deck sandwich. He
regretfully observed that whereas our
esthetic sense had once been pleased
by such a dainty little figurine as the
china shepherdess, we were now regaled
by only such heroic figures as the billboard
likeness of the lady who keeps
her schoolgirl complexion by using a
certain kind of soap and proclaims her
secret to all who read. He was saddened
by these thoughts and yearned for a
return of the more simple but much
more wholesome aesthetic attitudes
currents in the days of his early manhood.</p>

<p>Mrs. Katharine Darst says that
when there was a call for questions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
they were slow coming, and dull when
finally blurted out. Then there was a
long, embarrassing pause. And finally,
“Well, we’ve heard from the educated.
Now, have the ignorant anything to
ask?” ... this from the Chairman.
Chesterton had such a vicious way of
tearing poseurs apart with his sharp
shafts that the reluctance of the audience
to place itself at his mercy was
natural. But here was too good a
chance to miss. A number who had
hesitated to make inquiries were on
their feet at once. If they asked as
the ignorant, they felt that they were
armed against Chesterton’s barbs!</p>

<p>A group of St. Louis women also
heard Chesterton deliver a lecture paradoxically
entitled,</p>

<p>“The New Enslavement of Women.”</p>

<p>This gave a compelling portrayal of
how women exchanged the freedom of
home for the slavery of office,</p>

<p>“Twenty million young women rose
to their feet with the cry, ‘WE WILL
NOT BE DICTATED TO!’ And immediately
proceeded to become stenographers!”</p>

<span class="subhead">SOME RECOLLECTIONS OF G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. Bernard Shaw told the author
that he was so much struck by a review
of Scott’s “Ivanhoe” which appeared
in the “Daily News” while Chesterton
was holding his earliest notable
job as feuilletonist to the paper that he
wrote to him, “asking him who he was
and where he came from, as he was evidently
a new star in literature. He was
either too shy or too lazy to answer.
The next thing I remember is his lunching
with us on quite intimate terms,
accompanied by Belloc.</p>

<p>“Our actual physical contacts, however,
were few, as he never belonged to
the Fabian Society nor came to its meetings
(this being my set) whilst his
Fleet Street Bohemianism lay outside
my vegetarian, teetotal, non-smoking
tastes. Besides, he apparently liked
literary society; and it had the grace
to like him. I avoided it and it loathed
me.</p>

<p>“But, of course, we were very conscious
of one another. I enjoyed him
and admired him keenly; and nothing
could have been more generous than his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
treatment of me. Our controversies
were exhibition spars, in which nothing
could have induced either of us to hurt
the other.”</p>

<p>In July, 1933, the Canadian Authors’
Association paying its first official visit
to England, was entertained at Claridge’s
by the Royal Society of Literature.
Miss Paty Carter recalls that at
the end of the luncheon the toast was
proposed by Rudyard Kipling and ably
seconded by Chesterton. The contrast
in appearance between the mover and
seconder of the toast, caused a ripple of
amusement: a contrast that might be
likened to the Giant and Jack in the
fairy story. Though Kipling, in reality,
was only slightly below average size,
and if a giant, Chesterton at least conveyed
the impression of an amiable,
gentle, likable giant.</p>

<p>“You will be much puzzled at my
occupying any space—so much space—in
this august assembly,” he began,
“and why any word of mine could possibly
add to what this great literary
genius, Mr. Kipling, has said. I cannot
pose as a newspaper man; one reads of
newspaper men slipping in through
half-closed doors.</p>

<p>“Now, no one could possibly think of
me as slipping through a half-closed
door! (Laughter).</p>

<p>“I do not know Canada as Mr. Kipling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
knows it. I have traveled here and
there in the miserable capacity of one
giving lectures. I might call myself a
lecturer; but then again I fear some of
you may have attended my lectures.
The reason for my presence here today
is to return hospitality. I have been
twice to Canada. My first visit was
made twelve years ago when I crossed
to the Dominion from America—that
was in the early days of Prohibition.
The second time I went up the St. Lawrence.
Then I knew that Canada had
the foundations of all literature, because
she had indeed a country. There was
that vast natural background necessary
to the growth of literary culture, and
there was also what is necessary for
all literature—legend. On the Plains
of Abraham I was uplifted in the sense
in which poetry or great music or even
a great monument uplifts one.</p>

<p>“The magnificent cordiality and
courtesy of the Canadian people was,
to me, amazing. The hospitality of the
Canadian Authors’ Association was
overwhelming. The Canadian Literature
Society rushed out to welcome any
stray traveler, and in the confusion I
was mistaken for a literary man.
(Laughter). I tried to explain I was
merely a lecturer, and one of the first
things for a lecturer to do is talk about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
things he does not understand, such as
Canada.”</p>

<p>“Are you coming with us to Downing
Street, Mr. Chesterton?” asked Miss
Carter as the authors all left the hotel.</p>

<p>“No—o,” he drawled, with a delicious
sort of chant. “Unfortunately, I have
to attend a wretched meeting with
three other men; all madmen, like myself!”</p>

<p>Mr. James Truslow Adams happened
to have been one of the four or five
Americans elected to the Royal Society
of Literature, and so he found himself
in the rather odd situation of an American
who was entertaining Canadians at
an empire meeting.</p>

<p>“Chesterton,” recalls Mr. Adams,
“was very witty, and although he took
a number of sharp cracks at American
journalism, I being the only person in
the room who was not of the British
Empire, there was nothing untrue or
unkind. I have an extremely vivid impression
of the man, not only of his
enormous physical bulk and of his constant
mopping of his forehead with his
handkerchief, but also of his intellectual
vitality.”</p>

<p>The President of the Canadian Authors’
Association, the late Charles W.
Gordon (Ralph Connor) was “struck
with the freshness of Chesterton’s
thought, the brilliancy of his imagination,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
and his warm human sympathy. I
had heard him spoken of as cold, but I
could not say that of his speech or of
his personality that day.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rodolphe L. Megroz made a pilgrimage
in 1922, to Chesterton’s home.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, certainly, sir,” said the
railway porter at Beaconsfield when
asked where Chesterton lived. “Turn
to your left at the bridge and along the
road to the old town. When you come
to the film studios, go across into the
side road and it’s surrounded by a field.
His house is called ‘Top Meadow’.”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Chesterton received the
visitor in a little room with white-washed
walls and book-cases, and a
long desk below a window that ran the
length of the room. Megroz was anxious
to compare Chesterton’s ideas with
those of H.&nbsp;G. Wells whom he had seen
shortly before, and particularly wished
to question the former’s opinions on
patriotism and nationalism. Although
such books as the jolly “Napoleon of
Notting Hill” belonged to the pre-war
period, G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.’s own journalistic writings
had shown no change in his dislike
of internationalism and the kind of
social organization favored by Wells.</p>

<p>“The trouble is,” he said, “that terms
like patriotism and nationalism are very
often used by people who mean something
quite different from what I mean.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
My idea in ‘The Napoleon of Notting
Hill’ was that men have a natural loyalty
for their own home and their own
land, I do not see why, instead of progress
lying in the direction of bigger
and bigger everything, it should not be
found in the opposite direction, in local
patriotism. I say let a man go on loving
his own home, he will all the better
recognize the other fellow’s right to do
so.”</p>

<p>“H.&nbsp;G. Wells,” continued Chesterton,
“talks about abstractions like the World
State, which has no root. The League
of Nations lost its grip on realities by
ignoring local patriotism.”</p>

<p>When Megroz repeated Chesterton to
H.&nbsp;G. Wells the latter remarked,</p>

<p>“Possibly the World State is an abstraction
at present, but what are not
abstractions are the flying machines
and poison gas; electricity and wireless;
the fact that the food grown in India
may be eaten in England, and the food
grown in Australia may be eaten at the
Cape. These are hard facts, and they
demand sane treatment as hard facts,
and the only possible sane treatment is
to bring them under one comprehensive
control.”</p>

<p>Megroz got the impression that Chesterton
was “certainly a romanticist,
often escaping from reality. By fantasies,
among which may be included<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
his medievalism; but always one comes
back to his great sanity, his poetic insight,
his sweetness which redeemed
all his propaganda, illuminated his
poetry, and could fill even the detective
story with a wisdom akin to mysticism.”</p>

<p>What Chesterton wrote his friend
Mr. W.&nbsp;R. Titterton about Wells is pertinent,
and is here published for the
first time, and with Mr. Wells’ leave,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="in0">My dear Titterton:</p>

<p>I think we might drop the formal address
on both sides; especially as I
want to write to you about a personal
feeling which I don’t want you to take
too officially, or in that sense too seriously.
I ought to have written direct
to Pugh to thank him for his great
generosity in giving us his most interesting
sketch about Wells, which you
were good enough to arrange for us.
My task is made a little more delicate
now, because there is something I feel
about it, which I do hope neither he nor
you would exaggerate or misunderstand.
I was the more glad of his kind offer,
when he made it, because I thought nobody
could more ably and sincerely appreciate
Wells; and I was rather pleased
that Wells should be appreciated in a
paper where he had been so often criticized.
I do hope this work will not
turn into anything that looks like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
mere attack on Wells; especially in the
rather realistic and personal modern
manner, which I am perhaps too Victorian
myself to care very much about.
I do not merely feel this because I have
managed to keep Wells as a friend on
the whole. I feel it much more (and I
know you are a man to understand such
sentiments) because I have a sort of
sense of honor about him as an enemy,
or at least a potential enemy. We are
so certain to collide in controversial
warfare, that I have a horror of his
thinking I would attack him with anything
but fair controversial weapons.
My feeling is so entirely consistent with
a faith in Pugh’s motives, as well as an
admiration of his talents, that I honestly
believe I could explain this to him
without offense; and I will if necessary
write to him to do so; but I thought I
would write to you first; as you know
him and may possibly know his aims
and attitude as I do not.</p>

<p>I am honestly in a very difficult position
on the “New Witness,” because
it is physically impossible for me really
to edit it, and also do enough outside
work to be able to edit it unpaid, as
well as having a little over to give to it
from time to time. What we should
have done without the loyalty and capacity
of you and a few others I can’t
imagine. I cannot oversee everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
that goes into the paper and it would
certainly be most uncomfortable for
either of us to exercise our rights of
“cutting” stuff given to us under such
circumstances as Pugh’s: but I think I
should exercise it if Pugh went very
far in the realistic manner about some
of the weak points in Wells’ career.
There were one or two phrases about
old quarrels in the last number which
strike a note I should really regret
touching more serious things; and I
should like to consult with you about
such possibilities before they appear in
the paper. I cannot do it with most
things in the paper, as I say; and nobody
could possibly do it better than
you. On the other hand, I cannot resign,
without dropping, as you truly
say, the work of a great man who is
gone; and who, I feel, would wish me to
continue it. It is like what Stevenson
said about Marriage and its duties:
“There is no refuge for you; not even
suicide.” But I should have to consider
even resignation, if I felt that the acceptance
of Pugh’s generosity really
gave him the right to print something
that I really felt bound to disapprove.
It may be that I am needlessly alarmed
over a slip or two of the pen, in vivid
descriptions of a very odd character;
and that Pugh really admires his Big
Little H.&nbsp;G. as I thought he did at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
beginning of the business. I only write
this to confide to you what is in my
mind, which is far from an easy task;
but I think you are one to understand.
If the general impression on the reader’s
mind is of the Big Wells and not the
little Wells, I think the doubt I mean
would really be met.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 1em;">Yours always sincerely,</span><br>
G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton.
</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Titterton wrote in a letter a few
years ago:</p>

<p>“Edward Macdonald assists G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.
in editing the ‘Rag.’ In fact he does all
the technical editing, though G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.
controls the strategy. He is a splendid
fellow, very simple and humble, very
loyal, very wise. His editing of “G.&nbsp;K.’s
Weekly” is a labor of love. What I
know of G.&nbsp;K. you know already.
You must be with him day by day
to see the infinite simplicity—innocence—and
friendliness of the man. We are
fortunate to be led by a little child.
When we were starting the Distributist
League, I suggested that it should be
called ‘The League of the Little Man.’
And G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. said that, though he liked
the title, he thought that, with him as
President, it would be regarded as a
great joke. Probably it would have
been. Yet, in fact, he IS the little
Man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>Mr. Hugo C. Riviere has pleasant recollections
of having painted Chesterton’s

<p>“What excellent talk I heard when he
was sitting to me. It was, as I so often
saw him, in his big Inverness cape with
that massive head at that time covered
with a big mane of brown hair, his hat
on the grass and a favorite sword stick
brandished against the sky. It was just
after his ‘Napoleon of Notting Hill’
was written. A little later I was to be
made a very proud man by receiving a
copy of ‘The Flying Inn’ and finding it
was dedicated to me. You know, of
course, what a fine large style G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.
had himself as a draughtsman with a
great and free grasp of form and character.
How often when dining with us
I have seen him take out an old envelope
and rapidly cover it with extraordinary
sketches. I have one carefully
treasured in my ‘Napoleon of Notting
Hill’ an old envelope covered with every
sort and type of hand and figure, some
in medieval dress, and some modern,
two or three clever heads of G.&nbsp;B. Shaw
and other clerical and political and imaginary.
How delightful were the illustrations
he made for ‘The Biography
of Beginners’ that he and E.&nbsp;C. Bentley
did together. I also remember G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.,
after writing an article, over his last
glass of wine when all of us, and he too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
were talking after dinner, and the boy
sent by whatever magazine it was destined
for, waiting in the hall. His favorite,
and I think, characteristic, taste
in wine was red Burgundy, but he did
not notice his food much, as he was far
too busy thinking and talking.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hermon Ould, the Secretary-General
of the P.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;N. Club, met Chesterton
many times. When H.&nbsp;G. Wells
found the presidency too onerous and
was threatening to resign, Mr. Ould
offered the office to Chesterton who
replied in a characteristic letter, dated
August 2, 1935:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="in0">Dear Mr. Ould:</p>

<p>You might imagine how miserable I
feel in having again delayed a reply to
your kind letters; and being again,
after a struggle, forced back on the
same dismal reply. The truth is that
I did very much wish to accept this
great distinction you have offered me;
and have been trying to think of various
ways in which it might be managed;
but have come back to the conclusion
that it really cannot be managed.
The delay was partly due to your
own persuasive powers; for I must admit
that I was a good deal shaken by
what you said about the possibilities of
using the position for many things in
which I believe. If I may say so, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
must be a very good secretary; and a
good secretary is much more important
than a good president. But I am practically
certain that I should not be a
good president. I am honestly thinking
in the interests of the Club; and I feel
it would be better for me to decline the
candidature than for me to resign
rather abruptly soon afterwards, because
I found the responsibilities you
describe too incompatible with the responsibilities
I have already. As you
truly say, it would be unworthy to accept
what is merely a sinecure; and I
really cannot manage this additional
cure of souls....</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours faithfully,</span><br>
G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton.
</p>

<p>Father Vincent C. Donovan spent a
good part of an afternoon with Chesterton
and his wife at Boston’s Chatham
Hotel. Many things were discussed,
but Father Donovan recalls that the
visitors were particularly interested in
their impressions of America. They
found Boston very English in appearance
and atmosphere. Among other
things Chesterton said,</p>

<p>“All the Jews have been hounding
me as a result of my ‘New Jerusalem.’
I am not a little hurt and puzzled about
their unreasonable attitude because in
that work I have honestly tried to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
objective, fair, and understanding, but
they won’t see that.”</p>

<p>Mr. Vincent de Paul Fitzpatrick first
met Chesterton at the Belvedere Hotel,
Baltimore, in February, 1921, and recalls
that he praised the persistency of
the Irish in struggling for their rights:</p>

<p>“When you hear of an organization
in England fighting for liberty, you
must find whether or not that organization
contains much Irish blood. It
means all the difference in the world.
If you hear in this country of a strike
in the Cycle Valley, it is nothing to get
worried over. But if you hear of a
strike in Glasgow, you may expect
something exclusive and exciting. The
reason is that a mass of the Irish poor
is found in that city, and the Irish will
not submit meekly when any person
or any group tries to trample upon
them.</p>

<p>“We see the English people grumbling
at the perpetual interference with
their rights and at the various restrictions
to which they are subjected, but
they are not organized. There are plenty
of old radicals in England, who, as individuals,
are sincere defenders of liberty,
but they are isolated. Take, for
example, old Dr. Johnson. With the
Irish Catholics things are different.
Their love for liberty seems to have
been created by the Catholic Church—their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
only corporate defender of liberty
today—is the Catholic Church. Liberty
means much to her—something to be
protected. She defends it with her powerful
organization. When we speak of
the English Labor party in England
fighting for its rights, we do not mean
the English labor party, at all, we mean
the Scotch-Irish Labor party.”</p>

<p>On December 7, 1930, Mr. Fitzpatrick
had a long talk with Chesterton at the
St. Moritz, New York City. It was the
eve of the feast of the Immaculate Conception,
and Chesterton was thinking of
his newly found Faith,</p>

<p>“It stands to reason that Christmas
means more to me now that I am a
Catholic than it did before I was converted
to the Faith. But Christmas has
meant much to me ever since my boyhood.
I believed in Christmas before I
believed in Christ. In the years immediately
before my conversion I naturally
thought much more seriously about
Christmas, my thoughts became more
consoling and Christmas was more
beautiful as the passing days drew me
nearer to the Church.</p>

<p>“I believed in the spirit of Christmas
and I liked Christmas, even when I was
a boy filled with radicalistic tendencies
when I really thought I was atheistic.
In those days I wrote a poem to the
Blessed Virgin. I was quite young and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
the poem, God help me, must have
been a rather wretched thing, though
I imitated Swinburne, or at least, tried
to imitate him when I wrote it.</p>

<p>“From my early years I had an affection
for the Blessed Virgin and for
the Holy Family. The story of Bethlehem
and the story of Nazareth appealed
to me deeply when I was a boy. Long
before I joined the Catholic Church the
Immaculate Conception had my allegiance.
That allegiance has been intensified
steadily.</p>

<p>“Aside from the teaching of the
Church on the subject, a doctrine which
we as Catholics accept, the thought that
there was in all the ages one creature,
and that creature a woman, who was
preserved from the slightest taint of
sin, won my heart.”</p>

<p>Mother Mary St. Luke recalls that
during Chesterton’s visit to Rome in
the late Autumn of 1929, he went several
times to the Convent of the Holy
Child, where he lectured one day before
a crowded audience on “Thomas More
and Humanism.” At the conclusion,
a Father Cuthbert thanked the speaker
and expressed the appreciation of the
audience, remarking on the mental resemblance
of More and Chesterton, saying
that he could quite well imagine
them sitting together making jokes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
some of them VERY good, and some
of them VERY bad.</p>

<p>The Chestertons were also present in
the Vatican at the reading of the Degree
for the Beatification of the English
Martyrs. At the conclusion of the
ceremony there was the usual rush and
confusion in the neighborhood of the
cloak-room next to the sala Clementina.
A group of Holy Child pupils having
gathered around Chesterton, and learned
of his dismay at not being able to retrieve
his famous cloak from the “Bussolanti”
on account of the milling
crowd, plunged into the melee and
brought it back to him in triumph.
They also secured a taxi for them in
the Piazza di San Pietro—no small feat
on such an occasion! G.&nbsp;K. expressed
his appreciation of their efforts in his
own beautiful “architectural” handwriting,
which constitutes one of the most
treasured possessions of the school,</p>

<span class="subhead">CHESTERTON AT NEW HAVEN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Thomas Caldecot Chubb met Chesterton
at the Elizabethan Club in New
Haven almost twenty years ago, and
his initial impression still persists that
he was a large man in every way,
“Physically, of course, he was the size
of Falstaff, but that is not all I am
talking about. Perhaps the best way
of saying what I mean, is to point out
that he had this further in common
with the huge knight who is, in a sense,
truly Shakespeare’s most tragic figure:
that beneath surface-wit and brilliance
there was something one must label
deep and profound.”</p>

<p>Chesterton had been lecturing to a
typical Yale audience of the early ’20’s—four
or five consciously literary undergraduates
who made a grim duty of
never missing such a talk, and about
ninety percent of the membership of the
local women’s clubs. The Speaker
spilled over, like a wine keg broached,
into the Middle Ages. Among other
things, he spoke, naturally, of their individual
craftsmanship. He related how
it appeared even in such matters as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
meat and drink. He regretted with a
nostalgic gusto those gone days when,
as he put it, every monastery, almost
every home had its own brand of liqueur
or wine. Then he was transported from
the crowded hall with its murmurs of
polite, not too comprehending, applause,
and made to stand in the dark living
room of the white building across the
street, with its comfortable shabby
leather chairs, and its stiff painting of
an acidulous and very white-faced Virgin
Queen; and as he stood there—wearing
a grey suit (so the picture,
though perhaps inaccurately after so
long a time, comes back to Chubb) and
holding a cup of tea in one hand, his
eyeglasses in the other—Chubb was introduced
to him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chesterton,” Chubb said, “you
have your wish.”</p>

<p>Obviously, he wanted to know what
wish and how he had it.</p>

<p>“Thanks to Prohibition, every house
is making, if not its own liqueur, at
least its own likker.”</p>

<p>It cannot truthfully be related that
he was hugely diverted by Chubb’s attempt
at being facetious. Bathtub gin
was, it may be supposed, hardly just the
evocation he would have wished of the
spirit of the age of Abelard and Aquinas.
And furthermore, Prohibition was
a serious matter, not a jesting one. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
Chubb was properly covered with an
appropriate undergraduate confusion
which he tried to hide by holding out
a copy of “The Ballad of the White
Horse.” This haltingly—after his previous
boldness—he asked him to autograph
and to write a verse from it upon
the fly-leaf.</p>

<p>“There is no need to go into details
about his courteous compliance other
than to indicate the thrill it gave me,”
recollects Chubb, “by saying that in
that varnished period the ‘Ballad’ seemed
to me a high point in English poetry.
It seemed almost incredible I was actually
talking to and facing the man who
wrote it. But a confession must be
added to this statement. It was virtually
all of Chesterton I knew by having
read. That and ‘Lepanto’ were the
only Chestertonian works I had deigned
to cast my eyes upon. Of course, I
knew the names of others. But that
anyone who could write this immortal
stuff should waste his time turning out
such poor trash as a series of fluent
novels, certain aggravating essays, a
contradicting sort of history of England,
and—horror of horrors—the
Father Brown ‘detective’ stories, was,
in a ghastly way, incredible. It was pot-boiling.
It was prostituting one’s genius.
It was selling out to Mammon and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
the Philistines. And that was, of course,
the sin against the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>“It is now necessary to reverse that
stand—though here perhaps youth’s
headlong egotism has merely been replaced
by incipient middle age’s complacent
one. For somehow the swinging
lines which relate Alfred’s adventures
seem a little bouncy now. They
are dated, just as a brass radiator and
acetylene lamps would date even a T-model
Ford. Even the young don’t turn
to them, being engaged in writing not
quite grammatical verses to Communism
and proletarian poetry which no
member of the proletariat can make
head or tail of. And ‘Lepanto,’ which—with
‘Ivry’ and what Tennyson has
to say about the Revenge—is among the
most stirring short narrative poetry of
the language, does not set the pulses
beating quite as rapidly in 1939 as it
did in 1922. But the entertainment and
wisdom of ‘The Flying Inn,’ ‘The Man
Who Was Thursday,’ and ‘The Napoleon
of Notting Hill,’ and the cool, paradoxical
truths—well, anyway, from time to
time they are true—of the essays, of
the history, of the writing on Browning,
Thackeray and Dickens, of the controversies
with that irritating but likeable
friend-adversary G.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;S., still have
their power to stimulate. And personally
I now believe that the best of Chesterton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
can be found, if you delve for it,
in the Father Brown stories; that out
of them can be mined by an attentive
prospector the purest Chestertonian
gold.</p>

<p>“All of which, if true, places the man
for us. A stimulating writer, a delightful
writer, on certain occasions even an
important writer, but was he quite a
great one? With Kipling, Wells, Shaw,
Arnold Bennett and perhaps half a dozen
others with whom I will not rashly
provoke controversy by naming, he will
be compulsory reading for every student
of the era. It is less certain that
the general public will turn to him
after a hundred or even after fifty
years.</p>

<p>“Yet he has given a lot, and in no
way more than by his provocative way
of seeing and saying things. He loves
Meredith and he hates Hardy, yet he
nails truth to the wall by saying that
the man of the two who had a healthy
point of view had the perverse and
crabbed style, whereas the one with the
perverse and crabbed point of view had
the healthy and manly style. He stated
pungently and accurately—writing of
‘The Book of Snobs’—that ‘aristocracy
does not have snobs any more than
democracy does.’ Thackeray might
have learned something from this. He
had the insight to realize that Browning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
was among the finest love poets of
the world though quite to the contrary
runs the general opinion. (A similar,
though not the same, revolutionary
statement might be made of our own
E.&nbsp;A. Robinson, substituting perhaps
emotion for love.) He considered—a
half truth—that the whole of present
day England was the remains of Rome;
and—a whole truth—that Henry VIII
was as unlucky in his wives as they
were in him. Which statements,
plucked very haphazardly from out of
his writings, ought to indicate what I
mean.”</p>

<p>Another who heard him at Yale was
Mr. Harold Chapman Bailey:</p>

<p>“Chesterton’s lecture, as I recall it,
was given in the Sprague Memorial
Hall, which is part of the Yale Music
School. The entire subject matter of
the Chesterton address has escaped me,
but in the question period afterward
the first two or three questions were
so puerile that despite my youth I was
emboldened to rise with this query:
‘Will you not tell me something about
William Cobbett?’</p>

<p>“I recall that at first Mr. Chesterton
did not understand my question, but
when I repeated it, he seemed greatly
pleased to find that in far away America
there was some interest in Cobbett.
Accordingly he spent at least five minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
explaining to us who William Cobbett
was, what he stood for, and how in
a measure Cobbett was his own spiritual
ancestor. He concluded by remarking
that the Yale University Press
would do well to get out a new edition
of Cobbett’s works. I have often wondered
whether this query of mine
played any part in stimulating him
later on to write a volume on Cobbett.”</p>

<p>Major James B. Pond also met
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. at New Haven, and had the
privilege of being present when Chesterton
and ‘A.&nbsp;E.’ (George Russell) met
at the William Lyon Phelps’ house in
New Haven. It was the first time these
two men ever met. Russell hardly ever
went out of Ireland and these two famous
men had to come to New Haven
to get personally acquainted. It happened
they were both lecturing the
same day.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_NINE">CHAPTER NINE<br>

<span class="subhead">AT NOTRE DAME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Chesterton was guest lecturer at
Notre Dame University for the first
semester of the 1930–1 school year, delivering
eighteen lectures on English
history, and the same number on the
Victorian age of English literature.</p>

<p>Visiting Beaconsfield a few years ago,
Father John F. O’Hara, President of
the University, told Chesterton that he
had received “numerous letters from
former students who were just beginning
to appreciate the lectures he had
given them. Chesterton was that way.
One was forced to remember his striking
sentences, and the underlying truth
forced itself on the mind of the undergraduate
when greater experience made
understanding possible.”</p>

<p>As Chesterton walked out on the
stage and faced his first Notre Dame
audience, he leaned upon the lectern
and said, “Until quite recently, I was
not at all certain that I would be able
to be here tonight. Had I not come, you
would now be gazing upon a great
yawning void instead of myself.”</p>

<p>This bit of humor and the manner in
which it was expressed gave Father
Charles Morton the feeling that here
was a man of rare humility and of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
simplicity which always accompanies
genuine culture. As the lecture series
progressed, two other qualities became
prominent,—brilliance of mind and a
profound Catholic faith. No matter
what the subject of his lecture was,
whether in the field of literature or of
history, he invariably found a way at
the end to relate all he had said to some
profound religious truth. That people
should praise him as a learned man was
a source of genuine embarrassment to
him. It amused him to be addressed
as “professor,” and he invariably referred
to himself as a “mere journalist.”</p>

<p>Father Patrick J. Carroll looked upon
Chesterton, master of antithesis “as
himself the antithesis. A large lumbering
hulk of a man, you would expect
from him a deep, thundering speech.
You are mistaken: his language is swift,
sudden, arresting. Epigram follows
epigram, until you get tired of brilliance,
and begin to wonder if this big
man is not more concerned with his
sword play than with the serious business
of defending truth against truth’s
enemies. That is how you sometimes
think: but, of course, your thinking is
wrong.”</p>

<p>Prof. Norbert Engels of the College
of Arts and Sciences recalls that “at
every lecture knowledge poured forth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
He never used a paper, a note, or a reference
of any kind. He would quote
extremely long passages of poetry or
prose with utmost ease. I did not tire
of his use of paradox as he used it with
such consummate art. Those are inadequate
judges of his genius who pronounce
upon him from his writings
only. To know Chesterton fully, besides
his works, one should have heard
him lecture, in order to catch the spirit
of the man.”</p>

<p>All the breath and flavor of ages of
Christian culture came with Chesterton
in the opinion of Father Charles M.
Carey, “he entered our campus like
some great Catholic warrior stepping
down from the centuries that date back
to a time when England was really
‘Merrie England.’ Huge in girth and
mind and heart, he was the embodiment
of all that was good in that splendid
Catholic heritage.</p>

<p>“As his vast physical bulk lumbered
from the wings to the rostrum, then
slouched down in his chair, he threw
a ruddy scowl across the rows of young
University men before him, and a great
feeling of awe swallowed up the idle
chatter. There was not a single heart
in that young Catholic audience that
did not somehow experience the presence
of greatness in our midst. To the
man who knew little of the great apologist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
it may have been a moment of
confused terror and curiosity. To anyone
who had read but a paragraph from
his pen, it was the moment which finds
one helplessly silent in the presence of
a superior being.</p>

<p>“‘So,’ I thought to myself, as Chesterton
thundered and swayed slightly to
his place, his bushy hair in its own convenient
parting and his wrinkled and
baggy clothing left to look after itself
with a pronounced abandon, ‘can this
be the man that is so mentally nimble,
so sure footed in thought, so precise in
diction, so accurate in his thrusts, so
merciless in heaping wrath on adversaries,
and so loud in his frequent laughter
at the absurdity of those who oppose
his Christian fighting?’”</p>

<p>Once he began to speak, Chesterton’s
eyes lit up with a joy born of that common
bond that is the Catholic faith,
thus destroying all barriers of racial
differences because, as he said, “Under
the portals of our Lady’s Shrine, all
men are at home.” That was the spirit
that characterized his stay at Notre
Dame. To his young listeners he was
an inspiration. Every word that he
uttered had a clear, certain and convincing
ring in it that made for conviction.
He was thoroughly Catholic.
For him life was full of faith and
beauty and romance. Every word that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
he uttered had a freshness and wonder
about it. His adroit phraseology, his
accent and his inexhaustible flow of
genuine humor quickened his youthful
audience to frequent bursts of applause
and measured gaiety.</p>

<p>Chesterton had the honorary degree
of Doctor of Law conferred upon him
Wednesday afternoon, November 5,
1930, in Washington Hall. Many honorary
degrees had been conferred by
Notre Dame, but this was the first time
in the history of the University that a
special convocation of the Faculty had
been called to participate in the conferring
of a degree.</p>

<p>At four-thirty the academic procession
left the University parlors and
made its way to Washington Hall where
members of the Senior Class and the
guests were assembled. After an introductory
musical program had been
given by the student orchestra and Glee
Club, Father J. Leonard Carrice, Director
of Studies, announced the conferring
of the degree,</p>

<p>“The University of Notre Dame, in
this special convocation of the Faculty,
confers the degree of Doctor of Law,
<b lang="la">honoris causa</b>, on a man of letters recognized
as the ablest and most influential
in the English-speaking world of
today, a defender of the Christian tradition,
whose keen mind, right heart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
and versatile literary genius have been
valiantly devoted to eternal truth, goodness
and beauty, in literature, and in
life—Gilbert Keith Chesterton, of London,
England.”</p>

<p>After receiving the Degree from
Notre Dame’s President, the Rev.
Charles L. O’Donnell, Doctor Chesterton
replied,</p>

<p>“I only wish it were possible for me
to say, as you have suggested, something
of what is in my heart in the way
of gratitude. Gratitude is what I feel
most deeply at present, and it is the
irony of human fate that it is perhaps
the only thing that cannot be expressed.
If I said all the things which
are usually said on these occasions, I
should only be expressing my feelings,
for in my case, they happen to be perfectly
true. It is usual to say that one
is not worthy of such an honor, and the
vividness of my own unworthiness is
so acute in my own mind that I find it
almost impossible to express it and to
thank you for the far too generous
things which have been said. I have
given a series of lectures on a subject
on which a number of you are much
better acquainted than I. If I happen
to say something about the history of
the Victorian age, the history which I
am supposed to talk about, or if I happen
to say something about the Victorian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
age in literature, I am all too painfully
reminded that you have learned
history and have studied literature. If
I mention the Province of Canada, I am
reminded that you have studied geography.
Therefore I am afraid that I
am not only unworthy but almost in a
false position before you. I am a journalist,
and the one thing I can claim is
that I have endeavored to show that it
is possible to be an honest journalist.
Therefore, a great academic distinction
of this kind gives me a very strong
sense of gratitude. I can only thank
you from the bottom of my heart, not
only for this favor extended to me, but
also for the very great patience with
which you have listened to my lectures.</p>

<p>“There is always a bond between us
that would make you tolerant of me, I
know. I have only once before gone
through a ceremony of this kind and
that was at the highly Protestant University
of Edinburgh, where I found
that part of the ceremony consisted of
being lightly touched on the head with
the cap of John Knox. I was very much
relieved to find that it was not part of
the ceremony on the present occasion
that I should, let us say, wear the hat
of Senator Heflin! I remember that,
when I came to America before, about
nine years ago, when I was not a
catholic, and when I had hardly realized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
that there were Catholics in America,
my first sensation in this country was
one of terror. I recall the first landing
and that great hotel in New York, the
Biltmore, the name of which held for
me such terrifying possibilities. (Surely
there would not be <em>more</em> of it!) It all
seemed alien, although I quickly discovered
what kind and generous people
the Americans are. I did not feel at all
like that when I came to America for
the second time. If you want to know
why I felt different, the reason is in the
name of your University. That name
was quite sufficient as far as I was
concerned. It would not have mattered
if it had been in the mountains of the
moon. Wherever She has erected Her
pillars, all men are at home, and I
knew that I should not find strangers.
And, if any of you who are young
should go to other countries, you will
find that what I have said is true.”</p>

<p>Prof. Daniel O’Grady was invited to a
social evening with Chesterton at Notre
Dame’s Sorin Hall ... among those
present were the host Charles Philips,
Paul Fenlon, Pat Manion, John Frederick,
Lee Flateley, John Connolly,
Steve Roney, Rufus Rauch ... all either
professors or students. The affair
started at nine in the evening and lasted
until almost three in the morning.</p>

<p>When Manion asked whether liquor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
in England produced immorality,
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. replied,</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly it does in certain London
districts. When I stayed at the
Royal York in Toronto on my way down
to Notre Dame I noticed something
oligarchical about the Ontario system
inasmuch as there was a dance on and
those who could afford a room left the
ballroom on occasion and went upstairs
for a nip displaying visible evidences
thereof as one met them in the hall.
Moreover in Ontario a permit was
necessary whereas in Catholic Quebec
this Protestant condition did not prevail.</p>

<p>“I live near Oxford, and I often visit
friends there. In Cambridge too I
know and admire many men, such as
the poet A.&nbsp;E. Housman, and the historians
George M. Trevelyan and Holland
Rose, the great Napoleonic authority.
Speaking of the latter place
you know the old yarn about the Italian
doctor on his way to Cambridge to debate
some don there. On stopping to
inquire directions of some pedestrians
he was answered in Greek verse by
Cambridge students disguised as workmen,
whereupon he ordered the coachman
to turn around and go back because
said he, if the laborers are so learned,
what must the dons be?...”</p>

<p>When O’Grady said he had heard that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
the difference between the two schools
was that an Oxford man went around
as though he owned the place, while a
Cambridge man acted as though he
didn’t give a damn who did, Chesterton
retorted,</p>

<p>“And both about equally obnoxious!”</p>

<p>When the discussion turned to some
well known Englishmen, Chesterton
said,</p>

<p>“If my description of Lord Beaverbrook
was based on his journalistic
methods I would have to call him a
guttersnipe. I feel that Bertrand Russell
is a disgrace to English literature,
not only on account of his writings, but
also because of his way of life.”</p>

<p>“Masefield’s a fine fellow and a good
writer,” said Chesterton in reply to another
question, “but Ramsay MacDonald
had to choose Masefield as Poet Laureate,
there being no other poet so
sympathetic to Labor. However, Yeats
was by far our best poet. Yet hardly
ever has the best poet been made laureate.
There is too much politics in the
appointment, just as is the case with
the appointment of the Anglican bishops.
One need only consider Barnes of
Birmingham. The idea of calling York’s
archbishop ‘by divine permission’ and
Canterbury’s ‘by divine consent,’ has
always seemed to me rather far-fetched.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>When reference was made to Rebecca
West’s resigning from the “Bookman”
because the editorial policy favored the
New Humanists, Chesterton remarked,</p>

<p>“How extremely foolish that is—as
though that affected your contributions!”</p>

<p>Asked about Lord Beaverbrook who
had but recently died, Chesterton reflected,</p>

<p>“Birkenhead has always been a
puzzle to me because he was cynical and
worldly ambitious, and yet, it must be
confessed, overfond of his liquor. One
expects such a weakness only from a
poet or one who has the poetical imagination.”</p>

<p>A comparison being made between
certain types of Russian and English
characters, Chesterton went on to say,</p>

<p>“The Russians in their writings are
always brooding over fate or some silly
thing. For the most part the English
gentry are fine, sensible fellows, although,
of course, there are some
bounders amongst them. You will now
find not a few Catholics among them,
although for many years the only Catholics
were either English aristocrats or
Irish paupers.”</p>

<p>Asked if he found the Americans all
very mad in the pursuit of money, he
shook his head with a smile,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>“Quite the contrary, I find the Americans
less worshipful of money than
my fellow English. However, I do prefer
even our English gentry although
mad about money, to some of your vulgar
and blatant millionaires.”</p>

<p>During a discussion of the Church
and State, Chesterton remarked,</p>

<p>“I read the other day of a western
magistrate who sentenced a woman to
go to Church for the next fifty Sundays.
I wondered at the time whether
that was consistent with the American
doctrine of the separation of Church
and State. Even though we have a
state church in England, I do not think
that an English judge would have given
such a sentence.”</p>

<p>In autographing a book just before
the party broke up, Chesterton threw
a lot of ink on the floor, but merely remarked,</p>

<p>“I’m always cluttering up people’s
carpets.”</p>

<p>His hostess rather prim and proper,
kept shoving ash-trays at him which he
completely ignored and continued dropping
ashes from his cigarettes all over
the floor. But no one minded this little
thoughtlessness of genius.</p>

<p>As he put on his Inverness cape and
black sombrero-like hat he shouted out
in merry tones,</p>

<p>“If anyone ever tries to tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
Catholicism is inconsistent with fun and
play, I’ll say did you ever hear of the
University of Notre Dame?”</p>

<p>Before Chesterton left the University,
Mr. William L. Piedmont had a
pleasant chat with him. Asked what
he thought of our great American
sports, G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. answered,</p>

<p>“I witnessed the Notre Dame-Navy
game, and was much impressed by the
popularity that your game of football
enjoys. In my youth I played English
football and even rounders which might
be described as an English equivalent
of baseball.”</p>

<p>“I very gravely doubt if the nations
are becoming closer and closer together,”
declared Chesterton when the conversation
touched the League of Nations.
“Quite the contrary, I feel the
various countries are becoming more
national. An example would be in the
literary fact that in my youth Thoreau,
Hawthorne, Mark Twain and the rest
were as widely known and read in
Europe as in America, while today the
strange and awful stuff of American
writers is unknown abroad with very
few exceptions. I attribute this to the
fact that America has become so different
and in Europe the news hasn’t
gotten through yet as to what it’s all
about in America.”</p>

<p>On being asked if he thought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
world (and especially, the United
States) possessed any great thinkers,
he replied humorously,</p>

<p>“If there are any people in the world
today who do think, witness my ‘Age
of Unreason,’ I feel America can certainly
claim some of them.”</p>

<p>After confessing that he read very
few novels, but mentioning the works
of Sheila Kaye-Smith with approbation,
he went on to say,</p>

<p>“But I consider Rebecca West the
most interesting woman writer, if for
no other reason than because she is
gradually becoming more respectable. I
suppose (with a characteristic chuckle)
that her marrying a banker is not really
the cause of respectability, even though
marrying a banker may be a sort of
worldly parallel to being confirmed in
grace!”</p>

<p>Of the winner of the Nobel prize for
literature, he said,</p>

<p>“On the whole, I think Sinclair Lewis
is the scourge of God—a calamity in
some respects like the Great Fire of
London. I do not believe that Mr.
Lewis has enough sympathy with the
Middle West people of whom he writes,
nor has he the right slant on the people
of Main Street—as I have observed
them during my sojourn in America.
I think it about time somebody made
fun of the greasy optimism prevalent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
in recent novels. Lewis has a good
deal of righteous indignation, but what
he lacks is the positive moral idea
which should be found in the representative
literature of every nation. I like
Lewis when he is simply humorous like
in “The Man Who Knew Coolidge,” but
in general the bestowal of the prize is
like giving a medal to a great scavenger.”</p>

<p>When he arrived in Washington, D.&nbsp;C.
to lecture at Trinity College, Chesterton
gave Miss Syd Walsh an interesting and
picturesque description of Notre Dame,</p>

<p>“I think the faculty and students
awfully jolly people and the campus
itself a bit of medievalism with its constant
stream of youths in bright colors
pouring in and out of old stone buildings
with gilded domes. As long as I
live I will never forget their way of
letting off fireworks before a big game
and generally playing the goat in a
cheery way.”</p>

<span class="subhead">CHESTERTON AND AMERICAN AUTHORS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Recently there appeared a statement
to the effect that although Chesterton
had considerable popularity with the
average American reader, our authors
cared but little for the man and his
work. Doubting such a sweeping statement,
I wrote to various men of letters
who would serve as a good cross-section
of American literature, and their replies
proved unusually illuminating.</p>

<p>“Of course you may put me down as
an admirer of Chesterton,” declares
Channing Pollock, “though I recall surprisingly
little of his work. I have
read so much that, after fifty-six years,
I begin to find recollections blurred.
My admiration of Chesterton is founded
on my impression of the man—of what
he was and stood for; of his sincerity,
courage, forthrightness and general
altruism.”</p>

<p>“As a boy of ten,” records Thomas
O. Mabbott, “I read regularly copies of
the ‘London Illustrated News’ to which
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. was a regular contributor. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
am one of those people who, while not
exactly a prodigy, developed very early
and think very much more as I did
when sixteen than most people seem to
do. I often boast how little most writers
influence my own thought but Chesterton
is one of the few who did! I
read much of his work as a very young
man, and believe he is one of the very
few authors who impressed me <em>profoundly</em>.
I saw ‘Magic’ when it was
given in New York during the war—a
mark of devotion, surely, since I rarely
went to a serious play. Incidentally I
thought it <em>very</em> effective as an acted
play.”</p>

<p>Clement Wood first read “Heretics”
and then “Orthodoxy,” and immediately
obtained the impression that the author
was “one of the world’s most alert and
persuasively brilliant minds. He made
the persons treated of real and significant
to me for the first time. Thereafter
I read most of his work. His novels
are absolutely unique, I wouldn’t be
without one, and of all, the ‘Napoleon
of Notting Hill’ is the most precious—the
glorious effort to revive medievalism
today (which I am 100% against
intellectually) won me forever. His
Father Brown stories, in spite of the
ever-present propaganda for Catholicism—which
again I am against, but
I believe that if religion persists, it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
either be Roman Catholic or the Quaker
non-Christian (Religious Society of
Friends) non-evangelical faith—I regard
as by all odds the greatest detective
stories ever written. Poe and Doyle
are forerunners, and then G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.
whose every word is a work of art.
I have memorized the plots of nearly
all and the wording of many of his
memorable openings. His ‘Peacock
Trees,’ ‘Club of Queen Trades,’ rank
as highly.</p>

<p>“The play ‘Magic’ is immortal and
weighs more to me than all Shaw!”</p>

<p>“You may certainly enroll me as one
of his admirers,” affirms Donald Ogden
Stewart. “Although I do not recall the
name of the first book of his which I
read, I do remember, however, that it
was while I was in my senior year at
Yale, and that it had such an influence
on me that I immediately proceeded to
read every one of his books that I could
lay my hands on.”</p>

<p>Henry Hazlitt first encountered
Chesterton’s writings in 1916 and “was
quickly carried away by his stylistic
brilliance. My admiration, I must confess,
was not sustained at its original
level, but it most certainly never deserted
me. I never met him personally,
but I heard him debate with Clarence
Darrow, and was impressed by his immense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
superiority over his antagonist,
and by his charm as a man.”</p>

<p>William Thomas Walsh first heard
about G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. when he was a student
at Yale in 1909: “I think it was Professor
Chauncey B. Tinker who recommended
him in class that year, and I
seem to remember that William Lyon
Phelps was also a Chesterton enthusiast
at that early period. The book that
helped and influenced me most was
‘The Everlasting Man.’ I liked it so
well that I bought three copies, intending
to lend them to as many people as
possible, for I thought the whole world
should drink at that fountain of wisdom.
I soon discovered, however, that
some people loved the book and others
hated it just as fervently. This was
to be expected, perhaps, about anything
so profoundly Christian in its perceptions.
In fact, I began to entertain an
almost superstitious notion that the
book had a practical value apart from
literary considerations, in what St. Ignatius,
following St. John, called the
Discernment of Spirits. The various
agnostics and pagans to whom I lent the
book usually kept it a long while, and
finally returned it saying apologetically
that they had never found time to read
it, though I knew that every one of
them had read several other books in
the interim. Finally the three volumes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
disappeared completely from my life.
It was partly my fault, for I have a bad
habit of lending books, and forgetting
to whom: and as the number of people
who have to be reminded to return
books is apparently very large, I have
lost the best part of my library in consequence:
for it is usually the book
that one is enthusiastic about that one
lends. But I can’t help thinking the
Devil must have had a particular grudge
against so true and so powerful a book,
and has continued to hide all three of
my volumes on the most obscure
shelves of as many sons of Belial. Still,
as good comes out of evil in the long
run, it may be that the sons of these
benighted individuals may inadvertently
come upon them on rainy days, and
in their innocence read and be enlightened.</p>

<p>“In my biography of Philip the
Second, I have had to differ with Chesterton’s
interpretations of that most
misunderstood gentleman. But when
G.&nbsp;K. wrote his glorious ‘Lepanto,’ he
was still partly deceived by the tradition
that had so long dominated English
letters, so far as Spain was concerned.
It is the only mistake of importance I
have ever noted in the work of that
phenomenal man.”</p>

<p>Hamlin Garland met him at the Savage
Club in London, and several times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
in America: “As a matter of fact, I
introduced him when he made his first
address in New York City. I enjoyed
his mystery stories much better than
some of his more pretentious work.
From my point of view he worked the
paradoxes altogether too hard. He was
a very singular and interesting character.”</p>

<p>Waldo Frank remembers that when
he was “in college and out of it, the
essays of G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. stimulated me, indeed.
His critique of modern society,
his destruction of its complacencies, his
suggestive references to other values
now absent, meant a good deal to me.”</p>

<p>Myles Connolly feels that Chesterton
“will not, try as I will, come under the
head of remembrance. He seems vividly
contemporary, vitally alive. It’s a
worn-out form of tribute, I know, but
there’s none greater and I will say it:
he lives. The stuff of immortality was
so strong in him that beside his memory
as the world calls it, it is we who
are dead.</p>

<p>“Napoleon said that no man became
a writer unless he were a defeatist.
When life was too tall and strong for a
man, he quit, and in his pen he found
corroboration and consolation. That is
not, we are aware, altogether so. Although
it is true most men who write
are running away. But with Chesterton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
writing was not running away; it
was running to—running to reality, to
truth. Writing was life with him: it
was his breathing, his talk, his laughter,
his self. It might be said that
those who don’t like Chesterton don’t
like the truth. It might ever more accurately
be said that those who don’t
like Chesterton, don’t like life. That
superabundance of his, that hugeness
of his, is too much for them. They
crawl; he dances (albeit like the mountains
of Scripture). They pick-peck;
he waves that tremendous sword. They
count those corroded little pennies; he
empties that fabulous purse of his on
the world. He was an extravagant man;
extravagant of his riches, his light, his
life. It is this shining extravagance
that blinds the crawlers and pick-peckers
and misers. It is a glory too much for
them. A few words of ‘Thoreau’ are, I
think, to the point. ‘I fear,’ writes the
Concord ascetic, ‘lest my expression
may not be <em>extra-vagrant</em> enough, may
not wander far enough beyond the narrow
limits of my daily experience, so as
to be adequate to the truth of which I
have been convinced ... I desire to
speak somewhere without bounds; like
a man in a waking moment to men in
their waking moments; for I am convinced
I cannot exaggerate enough even
to lay the foundation of a true expression.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
Who that has heard a strain of
music feared then lest he should speak
extravagantly any more forever?’</p>

<p>“To Chesterton such words as ‘tremendous’
and ‘splendid’ and ‘enormous’
and ‘shattering’ were of common use.
(In fact, it was he who made such
words popular.) These words came
naturally to him because (and he would
be the last to admit it) he himself lived
these words; such words only could
express his vitality and significance.
He was a giant. There is no other way
of saying it. Except, perhaps, to say
he still is.”</p>

<p>James Branch Cabell “enjoyed all the
work of Chesterton’s early and middle
period. I admit that of his publications
during, let us say vaguely, more recent
years, I prefer to say nothing, out of
loyalty to a person that has given me a
vast amount of pleasure. I write this
after verifying the fact that his earlier
books when I re-read them, can still do
this.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I am a warm admirer of
Chesterton,” affirms Rabbi Stephen S.
Wise. “Apart from his delightful wit
and his genius in many directions, he
was a great religionist. He as a Catholic,
I as a Jew, could see eye to eye
with each other, and he might have
added, ‘particularly seeing that you are
cross-eyed;’ but I deeply respected him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
When Hitlerism came, he was one of
the first to speak out with all the directness
and frankness of a great and
unabashed spirit.”</p>

<p>Dr. Alexis Carrel well remembers
that “Heretics” was the first Chesterton
book that he read almost a quarter
of a century ago,</p>

<p>“The extreme clarity and brilliance of
his style impressed me greatly. The
train of his thought appeared to me as
strong, flexible, and shining as a steel
blade, and as merciless.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE AUTHOR VISITS TOP MEADOW</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In a delightful villa, called Top
Meadow, in Beaconsfield, a small town
of Buckinghamshire, about forty minutes
on the train from London, lives,
and has lived for some ten years, Gilbert
Keith Chesterton with his charming
wife. Chesterton, a huge man,
possesses the frankness and enthusiasm
of a boy, with unkept curly blond hair,
blue eyes, shaggy reddish brown moustache,
an exceedingly pleasant and attractive
smile, wearing clothes in a
somewhat careless and negligent manner.
Although clear and resonant, his
voice is not as powerful as one would
be led to expect for a man of his size.
He possesses the little mannerism of
twirling the ends of his moustache
every now and then. He would make
a joke with true Twainian seriousness
upon his face, but unlike the great
American such feigned seriousness becomes
too much for him, and he bursts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
out in peals of Gargantuan laughter
that often renders him speechless for a
few seconds. At other times the idea of
something funny will cause him to
laugh most heartily before he has had
a chance to express it in words.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">B</a> This entire chapter was read, corrected, and
approved in its present shape, by Chesterton
himself a short time before his death.</p>

</div>

<p>In a little hallway, Chesterton introduced
me to his wife, and then led the
way into the living room, a tremendous
chamber fully a hundred feet long, low-ceilinged
and surrounded on all sides
by shelves bulging and overflowing
with books of every description, a massive
fire-place built of large stones that
must have come from the bed of a nearby
brook, and a number of what proved
to be exceedingly comfortable chairs
grouped around the empty fire-place;
for it was midsummer.</p>

<p>As we sat down before the fire-place,
Chesterton said he was vastly amused
over a delegation from America that
had called on him the day before.</p>

<p>“They were making a tour of Europe
for the express purpose of unearthing
everything they could about Browning.
They called on me because I have once
written a book on the poet. It was a
grave mistake on their part to think
that because a man has written a book
on a particular subject in the dim and
distant past, he therefore knows everything
about that subject. At the time
of writing the book, I probably was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
little more up on Robert Browning than
the average person, but all my superior
knowledge has slipped from me long
ago.”</p>

<p>The question of modern youth came
up for discussion.</p>

<p>“Young people today have the idea
that old timers are landmarks. I hope
I do not fill as much space as Saint
Paul’s, but at least I am a Victorian ruin
dating from the year 1874. The last
time I was in New York I noticed that
the landscape was always changing.
When a baby is born he just has time
to look at the skyscrapers a week or so
before they are pulled down. Pulling
down New York seems to be the local
industry. A baby goes out in his perambulator
and his home is pulled down
before he gets back.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of the young
people today, Mr. Chesterton?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, “their chief trouble
is they don’t want to admit that old
people really do know the modern movement
because we are able to compare
it with movements of the past. But the
young people know nothing else but the
present. The result is that they do not
give modern conditions much thought.
For instance, if we had moving sidewalks
today, the young people would
take it for granted, the old ones alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
could compare them with the stationary
sidewalks.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that much change has
taken place in the last fifty years,” I
asked.</p>

<p>“We cannot grasp the tremendous
change that has taken place since 1874,
my birth year. Your country used not
to pay much attention to culture. When
Matthew Arnold began his lecture
series in America, he was worried about
what the American papers would say of
him for his criticism of certain phases
of American culture which he had
handled rather severely, but was relieved
to find that the papers had large
headlines reading,</p>

<p>“‘Matthew Arnold has side whiskers.’
But today you have a very high regard
for culture in your country.”</p>

<p>“What literary people did you meet
in America, Mr. Chesterton?”</p>

<p>“Among others I met Robert Cortes
Holliday, and Sinclair Lewis,” he replied.
“I found Lewis a pleasant fellow.
He was anxious to learn about the
conditions in England. That man, I
think, has considerable genius. I met
‘A.&nbsp;E.’ George Russell, also when I was
at Yale. He was completely wrapped up
in giving his lectures on agriculture to
you Americans.”</p>

<p>“What does he think of our country?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<p>“He has a semi-humorous, rather
critical, attitude towards you. He
won’t write anything much in praise
or anything particularly hostile.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">C</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">C</a> This prophesy of Chesterton’s proved to be
correct.</p>

</div>

<p>“What American cities especially appealed
to you?”</p>

<p>“Baltimore I found exceedingly
charming,” answered Chesterton.
“There is a quaint atmosphere about
the place that is hard to describe. Saint
Louis I also liked, a most pleasant cultured
city.”</p>

<p>“I once heard you lecture in Saint
Louis, Mr. Chesterton,” I remarked,
“and I agree with what you said about
the underdog:</p>

<p>“‘When the very poor man gets
angry and ‘bites,’ everyone, even the
social workers, treat him as though he
were a mad dog. Has he not the right
to get deliberately angry, the same as
anybody else? Once I debated with
Clarence Darrow, and when I talked to
him after the lecture, he seemed to
have sympathy for the poor man, the
underdog, who was goaded on to do
things, by saying that he was mad.
Why cannot people give the underdog
credit for biting when he wants to, instead
of contending that he is just the
same as a mad dog on a rampage?’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>When Galsworthy became the topic
of conversation, Chesterton remarked,</p>

<p>“Galsworthy always reminds me of
the solicitor of an old English family.
I cannot altogether feel that he reflects
modern England. He lays too much
stress upon a college education. He
believes that a man not blessed with a
college education might at any time
murder his mother. Galsworthy also
lacks the sweet balance of humor, only
a rather limited amount of humor
breathes forth from his works. Like
Darrow he, too, holds to the belief that
the underdog is always mad if he causes
the slightest trouble.</p>

<p>“Again Galsworthy never seems to
write with set purpose, while I am one
of those people who believe that you’ve
got to be dominated by your moral
slant. I’m no ‘art-for-art’s-sake’ man.
I am quite incapable of talking or writing
about Dutch gardens or the game
of chess, but if I did, I have no doubt
that what I say or write about them
would be colored by my view of the
cosmos.”</p>

<p>When the question of pessimism
came up, I mentioned that the week
before I had had the pleasure of dining
with A.&nbsp;E. Housman at Cambridge<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">D</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
who facetiously told me that he was
often compared to Hardy because both
their names began with an “H”.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">D</a> See “An Evening with A.&nbsp;E. Housman,” by
Cyril Clemens, 1937.</p>

</div>

<p>“That is all the basis critics often
have for forming comparisons,” replied
Chesterton with a smile, “but in this
case there is a measure of truth in the
comparison. Both undoubtedly have a
certain amount of pessimism. Poet
Housman’s, however, has the tang of
the fresh air about it, whereas Hardy’s
seems somewhat unpleasant.”</p>

<p>And to illustrate his point, Chesterton
quoted from “A Shropshire Lad,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Oh many a peer of England brews</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Livelier liquor than the Muse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And malt does more than Milton can</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To justify God’s ways to man.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ale, man, ale’s the stuff to drink</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For fellows whom it hurts to think:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Look into the pewter pot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To see the world as the world’s not.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A little later we went to the small
dining room which was a few steps
higher than, and was separated by a
heavy silk curtain from, the living
room. At a massive oaken table we
sat down to a delicious tea.</p>

<p>When I asked Mrs. Chesterton what
was the national dish of England, she
promptly replied,</p>

<p>“Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding,
undoubtedly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p>“Fried eggs and bacon is my favorite
dish,” spoke up Chesterton.</p>

<p>I then asked the author what would
be his choice if he had to go on a desert
island and could take but one book
along.</p>

<p>“It would depend upon the circumstances,”
he replied. “If I were a politician
who wanted to impress his constituents,
I would take Plato or Aristotle.
But the real test would be with
people who had no chance to show off
before their friends or their constituents.
In that case I feel certain that
everyone would take Thomas’ ‘Guide to
Practical Shipbuilding’ so that they
could get away from the island as
quickly as possible. And then if they
should be allowed to take a second book
it would be the most exciting detective
story within reach. But if I could only
take one book to a desert isle and was
not in a particular hurry to get off, I
would without the slightest hesitation
put ‘Pickwick Papers’ in my handbag.”</p>

<p>The talk switched to the Russian situation.
Chesterton thinks that Lenin
was of the mad Russian type, just such
a type as Tolstoy,</p>

<p>“But Trotsky is at once both more
commercial and cunning; he is the typical
Russian or German Jew.”</p>

<p>The Chestertons own a pert little
Scotch terrier named Quoodle. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
named him Quoodle,” explained Chesterton,
“after the hero of one of my
early, but alas forgotten, novels, in the
hope that unwary visitors like you
would ask about the origin of the name
and I would have a good excuse to talk
about my novel! But when only the
family is present we shorten the name
to Quo: a handy name and one that can
be yelled to the top of the lungs.”</p>

<p>Among the other delectable viands
that Mrs. Chesterton’s bounty provided
were some cakes made out of the white
of eggs, that caused me to say,</p>

<p>“These cakes put me in mind of some
period of English Literature.”</p>

<p>“They remind me, rather,” responded
Chesterton with a hearty laugh, “of
icebergs and I wish that I was sitting
on a large one just now. (It was an
extremely hot August afternoon.) But
if we must compare them to some
period of English literature they remind
me of the rococo period, the age of Horace
Walpole, in particular of some of
the decorations of his home ‘Strawberry
Hill’.”</p>

<p>Tea over, Chesterton suggested going
to see his garden. After putting on an
enormous sombrero, and taking in his
hand something like a small axe, but
which proved to be a walking stick
which his Polish friend, Roman Dyboski,
had given him, he led the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
through a French window out into a
tidy little garden. We sat on camp
chairs in a pleasant spot. Chesterton’s
one seemed somewhat frail, shaking a
little, and to make matters worse, the
cat Stanley Baldwin came along and
fell sound asleep right under his master’s
chair! If anything had happened
to the chair, Baldwin would have
awakened in cat heaven!</p>

<p>The conversation turned on the rather
whimsical subject of chairs.</p>

<p>“H.&nbsp;G. Wells in one of his books,” remarked
Chesterton, “has written several
pages on the subject of chairs.
Some non-materialists might very well
contend there is no such a thing as a
chair. They would argue that since
there are all kinds and varieties of
chairs, when you use the word ‘chair’
you cannot have any particular one in
mind: therefore the word is only abstract
and hence has no equivalent in
actuality!”</p>

<p>When I wondered if anything had
ever been written on the subject of
shoes, Chesterton answered that his
friend Hilaire Belloc had done an exceedingly
entertaining essay on the
subject, “Belloc makes the point that
the kind of shoes a man wears and how
he keeps them, is a better indication of
his character, than any other piece of
apparel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p>Chesterton told of a literary club
which had lately given a fancy dressed
ball for its members, and that he went
as Doctor Samuel Johnson. When I
asked who Mrs. Chesterton went as, he
replied with a merry twinkle in his eye,</p>

<p>“My wife went dressed as one of the
characters in a novel that I am going
to write in the near future! You see
that I devise ways and means to advertise
both my old novels and my new
ones!”</p>

<p>The subject of Rome and Mussolini
came up, and when I expressed admiration
for “The Resurrection of Rome,”
he snapped,</p>

<p>“I think it was a pretty bad book.”</p>

<p>At my disagreement, a look of mild
surprise appeared on Chesterton’s face,</p>

<p>“Well,” explained he, “it was written
just after a stay in Rome, and I think
that I made the fatal mistake of reading
the book too soon after it was written.
That should never be done by any
author. The longer after the writing
that I wait to read one of my books, the
better it seems.”</p>

<p>When I mentioned that Mussolini had
told me how much he had enjoyed reading
“The Man Who Was Thursday,”
and had found it exceedingly funny,
Chesterton answered,</p>

<p>“Does anyone find my books funny?
It pleases me to hear that, for at times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
I fear that my humorous works are
taken seriously and my serious ones humorously.
I also had an audience with
Mussolini. He did not act in a high
and mighty manner at all, but showed
a genuine interest in England and
asked me numerous questions about the
country. He was indeed a jolly card.”</p>

<p>“In what language did you carry on
your conversation,” I asked.</p>

<p>“We spoke in French,” replied Chesterton,
“and when leaving I said, ‘I
hope you excused my poor French,
Your Excellency.’ To which Mussolini
answered, ‘That’s all right; you speak
French about as well as I speak English’.”</p>

<p>After a moment’s pause Chesterton
reflected, “I don’t suppose that was
much of a compliment for my French,
because at that time Mussolini knew
practically no English.”</p>

<p>“When do you do most of your writing,
Mr. Chesterton?”</p>

<p>“Whenever I get a chance, I do not
care much for the typewriter and I find
pen or pencil much too tedious, for I
am a rather slow writer. At present I
do a considerable amount of dictating.
I can compose just as readily this way.”</p>

<p>One of the last questions I asked my
host was his opinion of Mark Twain,</p>

<p>“I have always admired the genius
of Mark Twain which may truly be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
called gigantic. Mark Twain dealt so
much with the gigantic exaggeration
of imagination; the skyscrapers of literature.
He was the greatest master of
the tall story who has ever lived and
was also, what is more important, a
thoroughly sincere man.”</p>

<p>As the cab to take me to my London
train was announced, Chesterton graciously
inscribed his “History of England”
in the following fashion,</p>

<p class="center">
“Greetings to the Mark Twain Society<br>
from an Innocent at Home<br>
G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton<br>
Known as the Unjumping Frog of<br>
Bucks County.”<br>

and Mrs. Chesterton added,<br>
“And from Frances Chesterton<br>
Wife of the Innocent.”

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_TWELVE">CHAPTER TWELVE<br>

<span class="subhead">FATHER BROWN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once in telling his creator what delight
Father Brown had given him, the
author asked if the spiritual detective
was a real person.</p>

<p>“Indeed he is,” answered Chesterton.
“His name is Father John O’Connor and
he lives in Bradford, Yorkshire.”</p>

<p>“‘Trent’s Last Case’ had recently
appeared,” Father O’Connor himself
writes the author, “and Chesterton full
of admiration for E.&nbsp;C. Bentley, was
humbly envious, longing to add to the
small (as it was then) crop of detective
stories. He also was bitten with costume
drama and would without provocation
‘lurk’ by the jamb of a doorway
with cloak-and-sword (he had a sword-stick)
as it were in wait for the Duke
of Guise. He had a column the next
week in ‘The Daily News,’ relating how
the forest-keepers of Ilkley apprehended
him for making passes at the local
trees, but released him on learning that
he was a guest of a Justice of the
Peace.</p>

<p>“Many a glorious day we had together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
under that hospitable roof of
Francis Steinthal and his ever gracious
wife. Chesterton himself tells how two
young men that first evening, after I
had gone home, wondered how a sheltered
existence like mine could ever
take part in the rude, naughty world as
it stood, and how this gave the first
push off to the Father Brown series.
Disguise is mingled with description—I
did carry a specially large and cheap
umbrella—had quite a habit of brown-paper
parcels—and the episode of the
sapphire cross—(in America, a diamond
cross, of course) has this relation to
sordid fact, that I was still vain in having
bought five sapphires for five shillings
in an obscure pawnshop in Bradford.
Many years later, in Bradford
again, some duffer introduced me as
Father Brown to two international
crooks who were playing themselves
into the book-trade, and they both disappeared,
leaving no trace, within
twenty-four hours!”</p>

<p>Father O’Connor never forgot the
day that he spent with the two Chesterton
brothers at St. John’s, Ilkley,
and has often wondered since if anyone
ever had a better chance to observe
their mental difference and their deep
attachment at such close quarters as he
did that day. Cecil was a Church of
England Conservative Fabian Socialist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
Gilbert was almost an official Liberal,
and at that time writing for “The Daily
News.” Cecil had already, in “The
Fabian Review,” battered daylight
through the Liberal Party in many a
large hole. This can be seen in his
“Gladstonian Ghosts.” From lunch till
tea and from tea till dinner, Cecil stood
his ground, and Gilbert must have
walked many miles around the large
dining table trying to reply to his
brother’s arguments.</p>

<p>Chesterton gave the author his own
version of how he first conceived the
idea for the famous character,</p>

<p>“While at tea with Father O’Connor
the conversation turned to philosophical
and moral channels, and I mentioned
with considerable timidity, a certain
rather sordid question of vice and crime,
which I intended to discuss in a future
essay. I was vastly astonished to find
that the priest not only had a thorough
working knowledge of the subject but
was able to furnish me with further
facts of an almost sensational nature.</p>

<p>“Some days later Father O’Connor
and I took dinner with two Cambridge
undergraduates. When the priest left
the room, the young men remarked on
what a thoroughly charming and cultivated
person he was despite the fact
that in his cloistered existence he knew
so little of the world. One of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
remarked, ‘It’s a very beautiful thing
to be innocent and ignorant, but I think
it’s a much finer thing not to be afraid
of knowledge.’</p>

<p>“The complete and crushing irony of
the remark so touched my imagination
that there was born in my mind the
idea of a priest who should appear to
know nothing, but as a matter of fact,
knows more about crime than the criminals
themselves. The point of him
(Father Brown) was to appear pointless;
and one might say that his conspicuous
quality was in NOT being conspicuous.
I have always thought that
the most appropriate compliment ever
paid my famous detective priest came
from the lips of a charming Catholic
lady who remarked, ‘I am very fond of
that ‘officious little loafer’.”</p>

<p>The prototype of one of the Father
Brown characters, Hesketh Pearson,
writes the author,</p>

<p>“I greatly enjoyed the Father Brown
stories, and remember his telling me
that he had described me in one of
them, though I cannot remember which.
My last meeting with him was not altogether
a pleasant one because he
started it by asking,</p>

<p>“‘Why, are you not a Catholic? All
the best writers of today are Catholics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
and you are much too clever to be anything
else!’</p>

<p>“I was forced to explain my view of
God, which was not his, and this disagreement
cast a slight shade over the
subsequent conversation—though I am
sure he was much too kindly a soul to
let it affect his feelings towards me,
which were always most cordial. He
was extremely generous to me at two
crucial moments in my life, and I shall
always remember him with gratitude,
admiration and affection.”</p>

<p>Rafael Sabatini’s first acquaintance
with Chesterton’s work “was made
through Father Brown, and I don’t
know that I cared more for any of his
creations. He was, we all know, one of
three contemporaries to whom allusion
was commonly made by their triple initials:
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. in his case. The other
two, G.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;S. (George Bernard Shaw
and Clement K. Shorter). One day that
perverse genius, T.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;H. Crossland (of
whom little may have been known in
the States) was in my study chatting
with me in his usual disgruntled fashion.
The conversation turned on
Shorter. Whilst he talked he scribbled
on a British Museum reading room
ticket, which he left carelessly on my
table. After he had gone I looked at
the ticket and found on it scribbled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
following quatrain, which has remained
hitherto unpublished,</p>

<p>
‘G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;S.<br>
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.<br>
G.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;S.<br>
N.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;G.’”
</p>

<p>G.&nbsp;B. Stern has “received intense
pleasure from a good deal of G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.
One of my most treasured books is a
first edition of ‘The Napoleon of Notting
Hill’ which excited me wildly when
I first read it, some time in my teens.
I was born in Holland Park, and used
to be sent as a child for daily walks all
over Campden Hill and up and down
through ‘Napoleon’ kingdom, so that
it had a strong local interest as well as
its romantic appeal. I think, therefore,
this remains the favorite of his works,
together with ‘Lepanto,’ ‘The Secret
People,’ and two or three of the other
poems; but I also greatly enjoy and
have re-read several times the Father
Brown stories and ‘The Flying Inn.’
Also I was present at the very first performance
in London of the play,
‘Magic,’ which seemed to me even then
inspired with those queer colored bursts
of truth which were so peculiarly Chesterton.”</p>

<p>The late Mr. S.&nbsp;S. Van Dine, author
of “The ‘Canary’ Murder Case” and “The
Philo Vance Murder Case,” wrote the
author, “I am very glad to be included<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
as one of America’s admirers of G.&nbsp;K.
C.’s Father Brown series. Father Brown
has long been a favorite with me.”</p>

<p>And Mary Roberts Rinehart, “Of
course I was a great admirer of the
Father Brown stories, and was naturally
pleased that Mr. Chesterton liked
my own work. In a way we formed a
sort of mutual admiration society.”</p>

<p>“Chesterton and I wrote a detective
story together,” recalls Sir Max Pemberton.
“I opened the mystery—he
closed it, most ably, of course. I can’t
remember what it was about, but I am
sure he brought the villain to justice.</p>

<p>“He was a truly great figure—a
worthy successor to the immortal Doctor
Johnson. Both had rare gifts, of
literature and Faith.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Chesterton was one of the great and
dynamic forces during the time he
lived,” declares Ralph Adams Cram.
“I ‘fell for him’ many years ago when
almost by accident I found and read
‘The Napoleon of Notting Hill.’ That
settled the case for me, and after that
I was, so to speak, his intellectual and
spiritual slave. Of all his books it seems
to me this, together with ‘The Man Who
Was Thursday,’ ‘The Bell and the
Cross,’ ‘The Flying Inn’ and ‘The Victorian
Age of English Literature’ are
those for which I care most. This may
seem a curious selection, but in most of
these he makes his points through indirection,
and in some ways this seems
to me a more powerful method of conveying
his ideas and inspiring the public
than the more explicit works, the
object of which is very obvious. This
is not to disparage anything he ever did—except,
perhaps, the Father Brown
Mystery stories, which seem to me
rather unworthy of him, though even
these serve to show the immense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
breadth of his interest, his knowledge,
and his literary ability.”</p>

<p>The late W.&nbsp;B. Yeats wrote the author
that he found Chesterton “a kindly
and generous man of whom I constantly
heard from friends, but as far as I can
recollect I only met him socially twice,
once at a Club dinner and once for tea
at a country house. So much of my
life has always been spent in Ireland
that I know comparatively little of the
English celebrities. I don’t want to
write about his works: I have read
very little of it, and to write even of
that little would open up great questions
I don’t want to come to any decision
about in my present ignorance
(which is likely to endure).”</p>

<p>In his “Autobiography,” Chesterton
states that he had some talk about
poetry and property with Yeats at the
Dublin Art Club, “a most exhilarating
evening.” Yeats asked Chesterton to
debate at the Abbey Theatre, defending
property on its more purely political
side, against an able leader of Liberty
Hall, the famous stronghold of Labor
politics in Dublin, Robert Johnson, who
was exceedingly popular with the proletarian
Irish.</p>

<p>“That passage from G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.’s ‘Autobiography’
is correct so far as I can
remember,” wrote Yeats in a second
letter. “It was a time when the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
Government was stopping discussion
and we kept discussion open at the
Abbey Theatre when it had stopped
elsewhere, by getting people to speak
on the conservative side and letting
debate develop as it likes afterwards.
Johnson who replied to Chesterton was
at that time the most important Irish
labour leader: he is still very important.
He was in the Irish Senate for
some years, Bernard Shaw lectured
either the week after or the week before
Chesterton. Both men were brilliant,
Chesterton taking the line that the
possession of small properties was essential
to liberty, Johnson putting the
Trades Union point of view that it was
more important for the workman to
spend his money on his children than
to save it.”</p>

<p>Cuthbert Wright’s only personal connection
with Chesterton was to have
been mentioned in one of his last books,
“The Well and the Shadows”: “Some
year ago I had published a review of
G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.’s ‘Catholic Church and Conversion,’
in which I drew attention to
what I considered a stylistic defect, his
mania for alliteration. He seems to
have remembered it during the intervening
years, and doing me the honor
to couple my name with that of Mr.
T.&nbsp;S. Eliot wrote as follows,</p>

<p>“‘It must be a terrible strain on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
presence of mind to be always ready
with a synonym. I can imagine Mr. T.&nbsp;S.
Eliot just stopping himself in time and
saying, ‘Waste not, require not.’ I like
to think of Mr. Cuthbert Wright having
the self-control to cry, ‘Time and fluctuation
wait for no man.’ I can imagine
his delicate accent when speaking of a
pig in a receptacle or of bats in the
campanile.”</p>

<p>Professor Roman Dyboski of Krakow,
Poland, was first drawn to Chesterton
when he read some articles in
the “Illustrated London News,” and
some passages from his historical
poem, “The Ballad of the White
Horse.” The professor suggested his
advanced students making a special
study on the author, and the result was
two Polish books on G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. Soon
translations of Chesterton’s works became
fairly numerous in Poland. His
play “Magic” had several successful
runs on Polish stages, and the Polish
Radio popularized “The Man Who Was
Thursday” in a dramatic version.</p>

<p>Shortly after his visit to Poland
early in 1927, Chesterton sent Dr.
Dyboski an introduction to a collective
volume of studies by Polish scholars
written to commemorate the Seventh
Hundred Anniversary of the death of
St. Francis of Assisi, and the services
of the Franciscans to civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p>On July 7, 1927, Chesterton spoke
on Poland at the Essex Hall in the
Strand. Crowds of his admirers were
present; the late Cardinal Bourne himself
appeared on the platform; the
Polish Ambassador took the chair;
Hilaire Belloc moved the vote of thanks
which was seconded by Dyboski. The
first part of the address struck all present
as the most illuminating English
opinion that had ever been expressed
on Poland,</p>

<p>“I am to speak on Poland, a country
very unfamiliar to the average English
person. In order to facilitate approach
to the subject, let me begin by saying
that Poland is Poland. This is the
kind of statement which, when I make
it, is of course called a paradox (Laughter).
Yet what I wish to express is
something quite plain and simple.
Those of you who have studied medieval
history, may remember the ancient
kingdom of Bohemia—situated, according
to Shakespeare, by the sea-side—now
you hear much of Czechoslovakia,
unknown to you before. Again,
those of you who are old enough to remember
the World War, will recall the
fervent admiration which we all felt for
the heroism of the Servian nation: now
we often hear the name of Yugoslavia,
which we never heard in those days.
As for Poland, she is now known by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
same name which she bore through
centuries, when she was a great power
in Europe, and by which our fathers
knew her to exist in those days when
she had disappeared from the map, yet
continued to live as a nation and to
struggle for freedom. That is why I
begin by saying that Poland is Poland,
and submit that as a fundamental fact
for you to consider before we go further.”</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine more eloquent
and emphatic words of recognition
for the continuity of Poland’s national
tradition through eight centuries
of recorded independent existence,
through a century and more of division
and captivity, and into the dawn of reunion
and regained liberty. Chesterton,
who in these words as well as in various
poems and essays, always acknowledged
in Poland one of the corner-stones of
the historical structure of European
civilization, remained a faithful friend
of Poland to his death.</p>

<p>“Grey Beards at Play,” a book of
poems in the Mark Twain tradition
with G.&nbsp;K.’s own illustrations, first impressed
the philosopher L.&nbsp;E. Gilson.
But the book which remains with him
as the most stimulating is “Orthodoxy,”
“When it came out I hailed it as the
best piece of apologetic the century had
produced. In a sense all his later works<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
are a variation on the same theme. I
was interested in the biography of the
conversion of a well known American
financial expert whose conversion was
brought about by reading in succession
Chesterton’s ‘Orthodoxy,’ Fulton
Sheen’s ‘God and the Intelligence,’ and
Karl Adams’ ‘Spirit of Catholicism.’ I
don’t wonder they would convert the
Devil if he had a sense of humor, and
open mind, and could pray for grace!”</p>

<p>Mr. Gilson believes that Chesterton
will not really be fully appreciated before
a century or two. The book of his
which he likes best is “St. Thomas
Aquinas:” “I consider it as being without
possible comparison the best book
ever written on St. Thomas. Nothing
short of genius can account for such an
achievement. Everybody will no doubt
admit that it is a ‘clever’ book, but the
few readers who have spent twenty or
thirty years in studying St. Thomas
Aquinas, and who, perhaps, have themselves
published two or three volumes
on the subject, cannot fail to perceive
that the so-called ‘wit’ of Chesterton
has put their scholarship to shame. He
has guessed all that which we had tried
to demonstrate, and he has said all that
which they were more or less clumsily
attempting to express in academic formulas.
Chesterton was one of the deepest
thinkers who ever existed; he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
deep because he was right; and he could
not help being right; but he could not
either help being modest and charitable,
so he left it to those who could understand
him to know that he was right,
and deep; to the others, he apologized
for being right, and he made up for
being deep by being witty. That is all
they can see of him.”</p>

<p>Eileen Duggan gives the opinion of a
New Zealander,</p>

<p>“One of the innumerable society
diarists who writes for a hobby recorded
an anecdote that illustrates Chesterton’s
complete absorption in a subject.
He had been given, rather foolishly, a
little gold period chair, and as he made
his points, it slowly crashed beneath
him. He rose just in time and sinking
into another chair that someone put behind
him, began at the word he had
last spoken. It was evident to all that
he had barely noticed the incident
rather than that he had decided to
ignore it.</p>

<p>“A New Zealander who heard him
lecture relates that his appearance after
a long delay caused the Chairman to
express relief that he had not been
knocked down by a tramcar. G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.
rose calmly and thanked him for his
solicitude, ‘but,’ said he, ‘Mr. Chairman,
had I met a tramcar it would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
a great and, if, I may say so, an equal
encounter.’”</p>

<p>“His journalistic training,” continues
Miss Duggan, “had taught him simplification
and the author of those penetrating
studies on Dickens and Browning
would put his points on Distributism
so that they could be understood by
the man in the street. A sacrifice
seemed worthless to Chesterton, unless
it were voluntary and not State-imposed;
in Distributism, then, he saw
the solution of the world’s problems, the
answer for soul and for body of its ills.</p>

<p>“It has been charged that he was the
enemy of Jewry, but his hand was
against only a small and powerful
Oligarchy within it which, he claimed,
harmed the poor Jew of the ghetto
more than the Gentile and, commenting
on the anti-Jewish excesses which have
outraged the world, he said that he had
now to defend the Jews against Hitler.
It will be remembered that he struck
at all internal abuses and certain lines
of his were arrowheads in the national
flesh. These for instance, on postwar
corruption drew blood,</p>

<p>“He was a Little Englander; partly,
one suspects, as a reaction from Kiplingism:
but in an age of peace he was
a defender of just wars. He inveighed
against those who blamed the older
generation in 1914 when they decided
that war was the only honorable solution
and later he said that a universal
peace, founded on a universal panic,
raised the point as to whether the supreme
moral state will be found when
everybody is too frightened to fight;
and dying, but undefeated, he repeated
as a creed, ‘Monarchy, aristocracy, democracy—responsible
forms of rule—have
collapsed under plutocracy, which
is irresponsible rule. And this has
come upon us because we departed from
the old morality in three essential
points. First, we supported notions
against known, old customs; secondly,
we made the state top-heavy with a
new and secretive tyranny of will; and
third, we forgot that there is no faith
in freedom without faith in free-will.
Materialism brings with it a servile
fatalism—because nothing, as Dante
said, else than ‘the generosity of God
could give to man after all ordinary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
orderly gifts, the noblest of all things
which is——liberty.’”</p>

<p>Chesterton examined and scrutinized
the conscience of England as he did his
own, but only a fool would deny that
from York to Cornwall he loved his
country with a Little Englander’s passion!</p>

<span class="subhead">THE POET</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Not a few of his readers feel that
Chesterton’s chief bid to fame is his
poetry. Alfred Noyes, for instance,
writes the author,</p>

<p>“Chesterton led one of the most
original lives of his day in Europe. It
is well to remember this when it is
suggested that men who avail themselves
of the rich experiences of the
centuries are merely echoes of the past.
The true originality does not consist in
inventing ideas that have no relation to
truth and no roots in reality, but in the
discovery and unveiling of something
that has always been there, though we
may hitherto have lacked the eyes to
see it, or the power to express and interpret
it. Chesterton had an expert
gift for making one see things in all
their original miscellaneousness, as
things that really <em>are</em>, and yet—<em>cannot</em>
be, or give any rational account of
themselves. Many years ago in a poem
on the death of Francis Thompson, I
wrote of the overwhelming mystery
that there should be a single grain of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
dust in existence, the sheer impossibility
of it on any rational ground, and
how the smallest atom defied exploration
and ultimately asserted a superrational
origin.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentdq">“‘I am ... yet cannot be, ...!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Chesterton tosses out his thoughts
in a glorious liberality; but I am proud
to think that this line unconsciously
found its way into two of Chesterton’s
poems afterwards—‘The House of
Christmas,’ where he speaks of ‘the
things that cannot be, and that are,’
and the splendid lyric ‘Second Childhood,’
where he says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentdq">“‘And stones still shine along the roads</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That are and cannot be!’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Like most men of genius he kept his
own immortal childhood all his life; and
it was in the matrix of it, the vision
that ‘saw’ as a manifestation of something
‘supernatural,’ ‘something that
ultimately defied reason, not because it
was merely difficult to understand, but
because it rested on an eternal and absolute
mystery (above and beyond the
range of secondary causes) it was in
this wonder at the abiding in the terrestrial
that he made me feel the power
of his faith,</p>

<p>“One of the greatest of all his poems
is the sonnet entitled ‘The Convert,’ in
which he describes how, after he had
‘bowed his head,’ he came out where
the old world shone white, and heard
‘myriads of tongues like autumn leaves,’
‘not so loveable,’ but ‘strange and light,’
in their whispering assumption that,
among the old riddles and new creeds,
he must now be taken as belonging to
a dead past. He sees them singing—not
harshly—‘but softly as men smile
about the dead.’ And then comes this
magnificent and soul-stirring challenge
from the ‘dead man’,</p>

<p>Francis B. Thornton, the authority
on Gerard Manley Hopkins, first knew
Chesterton through his drinking songs,
“An admirable introduction; they were
so much more than their title signifies,
and they transported me to the happy
age which preceded the Malvolios and
their hatred of cakes and ale. To me
Chesterton will always be the poet. He
not only saw what other men looked at,
he saw <em>through</em> as well, and it was this
faculty which gave an angelic quality
to his humor. He was like a bull in a
china shop, but it was a papal bull enunciating
principles in the midst of a
wreck of fragile half-truth.”</p>

<p>Mr. J. Corson Miller “was introduced
to the poetry of Chesterton by Mr.
William Rose Benet who dilated on the
vigor and splendor of ‘The Ballad of the
White Horse.’ I read that magnificent
work, and thereafter read all the verse
that G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. produced. I am a great
admirer of his poetical work. I admire
his flexible sonnets, with their vast
sweep of thought, and radiant vision.
His various lyrics, love, nature, and religious
lyrics, are all excellent; his religious
poetry is sublime. His well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
known lyric, ‘The Donkey,’ with its
superb last two lines, or couplet, is unforgettable.
His ‘Queen of the Seven
Swords’—his second last, if not his last,
published volume of verse, bears in my
humble opinion, the breadth and fire of
eternal life. His was, indeed, a great
spirit: no toadying, or cavilling; no
smirking or masking, but strong and
free, with the strength of the clean
West wind, he put his thoughts and
opinions and visions in books and papers,
and let the seeds of his ideas fall
where they would, with results be what
they might. His many-sided genius is
well known: political and social economist;
poet, historian, novelist, short-story
writer, artist and cartoonist,
playwright—hardly any field in art and
literature can be mentioned—without
his having touched it in some manner
and left his mark, too.”</p>

<p>Prof. Joseph J. Reilly holds that
Chesterton will be best remembered for
his poetry,</p>

<p>“The initial book I read was ‘Varied
Types.’ My first reaction was one of
delight in Chesterton’s brilliance, my
second a realization that his views were
colored so decidedly by his personality
that one could not hope to get a genuinely
objective appraisal from him.
This has always seemed to me an element
of strength and of weakness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
ever since I have turned to Chesterton’s
criticism most largely for the unusual
flashes of insight which he shows than
for any completely balanced judgment.
In one sense he is like a delicious dessert:
it is not the main part of a dinner
but no dinner would be satisfying without
it.</p>

<p>“My next acquaintance was with his
‘Orthodoxy’ which I found full of wisdom,
insight, and inspiration. As I
went on, I sometimes grew a little
weary of his paradoxes but changed my
mind when I happened one day upon his
statement that to him paradox was
‘truth standing on its head.’</p>

<p>“After reading his volume of poems
through several times and thinking him
over for many months preparatory to
writing an article on Chesterton as
poet, I came to the conclusion to which
I still cling that Chesterton’s best claim
to the attention of our great-grand-children
will be based on his poetry.”</p>

<p>John Gould Fletcher considers “Lepanto”
is Chesterton’s finest poem,
“next to that superb ‘Ballad of the
White Horse’—too long for most people,
I fancy, but absolutely characteristic
of his great, generous, simple, and
manly nature.</p>

<p>“I did not learn to like his poetry because
of a parent or teacher. From my
earliest years I have always read all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
the poets I could lay my hands on; and
in later years, I have continued the
practice. I read ‘Lepanto’ and the
‘Ballad’ some time back in 1912 as I
recall, during my early years in London—read
them and liked them. As regards
the American poets, I should say
that it was particularly marked in the
case of Vachel Lindsay.”</p>

<p>“I am on record,” declares Clement
Wood, “that he is the greatest poet of
his generation. I well remember when
‘Lepanto’ was recited to Vachel Lindsay
by Floyd Dell; but Lindsay missed
the rhythm which was ballad measure—seven
beats to the line. Lindsay was
influenced by Chesterton’s ballad measure
which he re-used in the ‘Congo’ and
other poems—but as four beats to the
line.</p>

<p>“‘The Ballad of the White Horse’ is
the greatest of all modern ballads, possibly
the greatest of all ballads,—more
sustainedly memorable, glorious
throughout. Many of the shorter pieces,
too, have my warmest admiration.”</p>

<p>“The story of my reading ‘The Battle
of Lepanto’ on the shore of Lake Michigan
to Vachel Lindsay is true,” declares
Floyd Dell. “Note the echo of
‘Lepanto’ in ‘General William Booth,’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentdq">“‘Dim drums throbbing in the hills half heard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Booth enters boldly with his big brass drum.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">“Booth was the first poem in Vachel’s
new style, and followed my chanting
recitation of the poem—which (my way
of reading it) was in turn based on
Yeats’ theories of how poetry should
be read. Vachel had an unparalleled
mental possession of the folk tunes (so
to speak) of American speech—camp-meetings,
soap-box, tramp, farmer,
Negro, and so on—but they never broke
through into his own verse until after
he had heard the theory of Yeats and
the poem of Chesterton.”</p>

<p>Thomas Caldecot Chubb feels that
Chesterton has been an important influence
in the shaping of a brilliant
American poet, “I realize that discussing
influences is dangerous and that
most people like to think of genius as
bursting into the world full grown like
Medusa from the forehead of Jove. But
quite the opposite is usually true and
most men of genius are but the latest—not
the last link—in an unending chain.
They receive, they use, they pass along.
And anyone who will compare ‘The
Ballad of the White Horse’ with ‘The
Drug Shop, or Endymion in Edmonstoun,’
written by Stephen Vincent Benet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
when he was less than twenty years old,
will realize that Benet obtained more
than a handful of his poetic implements
from Chesterton. This is a paradox in
itself, that the gusty panegyrist of the
days following the decline of Rome
should make an important contribution
to so native and so American a voice.”</p>

<p>No better way to end this chapter
than with what Stephen Vincent Benet
writes the author,</p>

<p>“Thank you for sending me your
Chapter on Chesterton’s poetry which
I have read with much interest. I have
always greatly admired both ‘Lepanto’
and the ‘Ballad of the White Horse’ and
I still re-read them.”</p>

<span class="subhead">CHESTERTON THE MAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Chesterton possessed one of the most
likeable characters of contemporary
literary men. There is usually something
or other that mars the characters
of most, but who would have Chesterton
different? Even his faults are beloved:
his weight, his tardiness, his absentmindedness,
his slovenly manner of
dressing, his sometimes careless way
of eating and drinking. In short he can
almost be described as Falstaff without
his moral grossness.</p>

<p>Chesterton lived for many years in a
flat overlooking the beautiful Battersea
Park, where Mrs. Lillian Curt would
often see him strolling in deep thought.
His wife Frances—a dainty little lady,
clever and level-headed and most devoted
to her husband—would sometimes
get anxious when he was long
overdue for meals. Then quickly donning
her outdoor garments she would
anxiously start off to find him, remarking,
“I am off to seek my Mighty
Atom.” The reference being to Marie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
Corelli’s “The Mighty Atom” which had
but recently appeared.</p>

<p>“I knew G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C.,” writes A. Hamilton
Gibbs, “when I was in process of
becoming an undergraduate at Oxford.
Being so grotesquely fat that he
couldn’t dress himself he used to appear
in socks at breakfast, eat hugely, and
then go out into the garden with a pad
of paper and a packet of cigarettes. In
the course of a couple of hours there
would be a ring of cigarettes on the
grass around him and when the wind
blew away his pages, he would scream
for help with a series of epigrams
which I am sure found their way into
his later pages. Whenever he went
from the country to London there was
always a little black bag in his hand.
In the bag was a bottle of wine, and in
the station refreshment room he would
order a cup of tea and a wine glass.
Many times I’ve seen him taking alternate
sips of tea and wine between
mouths of a penny bun!”</p>

<p>Whenever he visited Glasgow, Chesterton
stayed with Professor Phillimore
who occupied the Greek chair at Glasgow
University. Phillimore entertained
many literary people in Glasgow,
Hilaire Belloc, Thomas Hardy, Galsworthy,
and so forth. Usually disengaged
in the mornings, the visitors were
often brought to the Annam Gallery to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
be entertained by looking at paintings
and etchings. Mr. Annam had the opportunity
of making photographic portraits
of Chesterton in 1912, when the
latter was at his bulkiest. He seemed
much interested in his striking appearance
and in his likeness to Dr. Johnson.
He wore a dark grey highland cloak and
a tiny Homburg hat. As he was leaving
the studio a small boy stopped and
stared at the great man. G.&nbsp;K. noticed
the youngster’s interest and puffed
himself out to his very biggest for his
benefit. Nothing was said, of course,
but the pose was obvious. In the course
of conversation he made various references
to his appearance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hugh C. Riviere remembers
Chesterton as a school boy at St. Paul’s,
a tall slim youth who even then had
the feeling of the romance of weapons
that runs through so much of his work.
He went to stay with Mr. and Mrs.
Riviere after his marriage when his
wife was ill in bed and unable to see to
his packing. The result was that he
arrived <em>with nothing</em> but an old revolver
bought on the way, and his favorite
sword-stick with an ivory-handle!</p>

<p>The Sunday after the Great War had
commenced Riviere was staying the
week-end at a house a few miles from
Beaconsfield, and walked over to see
the Chestertons. They were in a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
national state of excitement and emotion,
as all were on such a day. His
first thought was, what could he do to
help his country,</p>

<p>“I couldn’t wield a sword as I can’t
lift my right arm above my shoulder.
I should be no use in cavalry, no horse
could carry me.” Then with a sudden
hopefulness and that humor that was
so often directed against himself, “I
might possibly form part of a barricade.”</p>

<p>The Chestertons, his brother Cecil,
and his friend W.&nbsp;C. Worsdell, all belonged
to a debating society known as
“I.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;K.” (I Don’t Know). In the
earlier period G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. attended the
meetings pretty regularly but later on
rarely, being, as his wife declared, “too
busy.” One of the earliest meetings
was at the Chiswick house, of his wife’s
family, the Bloggs. At the end of the
discussion Chesterton remarked in his
usual jocular style,</p>

<p>“We’re in a complete fog!”</p>

<p>But more than once he declared that
the speeches of the I Don’t Knows were
much cleverer than those heard in the
House of Commons. At one meeting
Chesterton could not find a chair, so he
was obliged to squat on the floor, and
he dropped down with a thud that shook
the whole house!</p>

<p>One year the Chestertons were coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
back from Bromley after a delightful
afternoon spent at E.&nbsp;W. Fordham’s
house where the guests had produced
some plays written by their host—one
of them an exceedingly clever and
amusing take-off of G.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;C. himself
which the original had greeted with
continuous chuckles and gurgles of
laughter. Having returned with them
year after year from this show and
knowing his habit, Riviere remarked,</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to have the usual
cigar, Gilbert?”</p>

<p>“I was not going to have a cigar and
I <em>don’t</em> want a cigar, but if it’s a case of
a holy ritual here goes,” he answered
characteristically with a chuckle as he
took out a cigar and commenced smoking.</p>

<p>While visiting Columbus, Ohio, to lecture,
Chesterton had a friendly discussion
with Professor Joseph Alexander
Leighton and Dr. T.&nbsp;C. Mendenhall, the
noted physicist—on the question whether
veridical communications from the
dead were received by living persons.
Dr. Mendenhall contended that some at
least of these communications were
genuine, and therefore established the
reality of life after death. Leighton
took the role of skeptic, contending that
when, as in some undoubted cases, bits
of information, quotations, etcetera, had
been received through mediums, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
probably were due to subconscious memories,
and that in other cases their apparent
supernormal character was probably
the result of coincidence. Chesterton
agreed to the genuineness of the
communications, but took the view that
they were transmitted by bad spirits
and that it was spiritually unhealthy
for living persons to have any kind of
traffic with them.</p>

<p>No one could condemn a thing in
fewer words than Chesterton. Speaking
about that much discussed book of
other days, Renan’s “Life of Christ,”
he said to his friends Desmond Gleeson
and George Boyle,</p>

<p>“I remember reading it while I was
standing in the queque waiting to see
‘Charlie’s Aunt.’ But it is so obvious
which is the better farce, for ‘Charlie’s
Aunt’ is still running.”</p>

<p>The old English advertisement of
“Charlie’s Aunt” always had a picture
of the old woman getting along at top
speed, with the words, “still running.”</p>

<p>Father Cyril Martindale did not meet
Chesterton very often, but he felt that
he knew him well all the same, “this
was because despite his shyness, or I
should say modesty, he <em>let</em> you know
him, and intercepted no barriers. This
modesty was again seen in his dealings
with young men. It never occurred to
him that they could have nothing interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
or useful to say, or that he
was called upon to act the oracle.</p>

<p>“And this simplicity could again, I
think, be seen in what people called his
paradoxes. He always insisted that
that was not what they were, but sheer
statements of the obvious. To him, it
was life as ordinarily lived that seemed
‘paradoxical’—it was amazing to him
that men could think the things they
did, especially as doing so issued into
so uncomfortable as well as, too often,
so wicked a life.</p>

<p>“Sometimes the constant appearance
of the word ‘wild’ in his writings irritated
me. He had a vivid and active
imagination, so that he saw all sorts
of connections and illustrations that
others did not: but his mind in reality
worked in a very orderly way. I think
the explanation may be this—he constantly
described himself as ‘lazy’ and
I expect that by temperament he was.
He always put down the rapidity of his
brother’s conversion with the tardiness
of his own, at sheer laziness on his
part. Now had he let himself go to
laziness, he would have been letting his
mind, too, go ‘wild.’ But he did neither.
Very likely he used the word in a
slightly different sense from the one
in which I used it: he felt it as the opposite
of ‘smug’ and so forth. It remains
that I think he had to conquer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
a real tendency to laziness, and so, to
letting his mind just hop about in a
(to me) ‘wild’ and disorderly way.</p>

<p>“I think he died in some ways a
broken-hearted man. There were no
signs of the world having learnt anything
that was good, even from its sufferings:
all the more noticeable was his
peace and serenity in God; and this is
why I do not hesitate to say that I
think there was to be discerned in him
<em>real holiness</em>.”</p>

<p>Father (now Monsignor) John
O’Connor known to fame as Father
Brown, recollects that on Sunday, July
30th, 1922, he had “the immense happiness
of receiving Chesterton into the
Church. Mrs. Chesterton was present,
profoundly moved, and Dom Ignatius
Rice, O.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;B., in the chapel of the Railway
Hotel at Beaconsfield, the first
public church in town. I remembered
his lines written years before,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentsq">‘Prince: Bayard would have smashed his sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To see the sort of Knights you dub.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will someone take me to a pub?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is <em>that</em> the last of them? O Lord!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will someone take me to a pub?’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“In 1925 Mrs. Chesterton followed
him into the Church on the Feast of All
Saints. They almost at once began to
sponsor the erection of a permanent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
church near the railway station. And
now it is being enlarged as a memorial
to him.</p>

<p>“Gilbert Chesterton and I were wont
to call down Mark Twain’s name in
benediction and to wish there were
more like him, whether in his own
States or any others. I recall many of
our delighted exchanges on Mark the
deathless. I was once thrilled to give
him a patiche out of something he had
not read,</p>

<p>‘Buck Fanshaw’s Funeral.’</p>

<p>“That he had not read it was to me
a miracle. He had read everything I
ever heard of that Mark Twain had
written.”</p>

<p>Patrick Braybrooke saw his cousin
Chesterton for the last time at Beaconsfield.
“It was a hot afternoon in summer
and in the sweet garden at his
home he recited poetry, made up verses,
discussed American hotels, and came
to the conclusion that Stevenson was
the bravest man who ever wrote.”</p>

<p>One morning not long afterwards as
he was sitting in the refreshment room
of a London underground, Braybrooke
picked up casually enough a newspaper.
“I saw some words and my world
seemed to fall into pieces. For I read
SUDDEN DEATH OF G. K. CHESTERTON.
It seemed like the end of an
era of literary greatness in every way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
But I was glad he did not have a long
illness—a long drawn-out anti-climax
was not for him. When his time came
he went home quickly, almost as
though like one of the Stevenson characters—hit
by an arrow. He went home
and the Catholic Church which he loved
so well took care of his soul and in the
little Church at Beaconsfield to the
subdued mutters of the Mass we said
our last farewell.”</p>

<p>Chesterton died on June 14, 1936,
and was buried in the graveyard of the
Beaconsfield Catholic Church. Just
recently the Republic of Ireland has
given a great bell for the Chesterton
Memorial Church thus inscribed.</p>

<p>“Presented to the parish of Beaconsfield
by friends and admirers of Gilbert
Keith Chesterton, to ring the call to
faith, which he so chivalrously answered
in song, in word, and in example,
to the glory of God and of England.”</p>

<p>Walter de la Mare penned a memorial
quatrain to his life-long friend,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Knight of the Holy Ghost, he goes his way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wisdom his motley, Truth his loving jest;</div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Transcribers_Notes">Transcriber’s Notes</h2>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made
consistent when a predominant preference was found
in the original book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced
quotation marks were remedied when the change was
obvious, and otherwise left unbalanced.</p>

<p>Footnotes, originally at the bottoms of the pages that referenced them,
have been sequentially alphabetized and placed
below the paragraphs that reference them.</p>

<p>The index was not checked for proper alphabetization
or correct page references. The entry for
“Chesterton, G. K.” has no page references (which makes
sense, as the entire book is about him). Some entries
that were misalphabetized have been moved to the correct
places, but the Transcribers did not do this systematically.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_i">Page i</a>: “unanimity” was printed as “unanmity”;
changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_12">Page 12</a>: “just ’ad” was printed as “just
’as”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_13">Page 13</a>: The footnote anchor originally was
placed at the end of the next paragraph, but was moved because the
footnote refers to the person mentioned in the earlier paragraph.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_14">Page 14</a>: “pledged to wage eternal against”
seems to be missing a word.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_30">Page 30</a>: “finding reasons for his” was
printed as “finding seasons for his”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_31">Page 31</a>: “with insufficient impudence” was printed that way; perhaps it
should be “sufficient”.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_38">Page 38</a>: “quiet chat” was printed as “quite
chat”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_38">Page 38</a>: “I remember how Lord David
Cecil when still a boy” was printed that way; “how” seems to be
extraneous.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_40">Page 40</a>: “in phases as colorful” was printed
that way.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_40">Page 40</a>: “points in phrases” was printed as
“points in phases”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_41">Page 41</a>: Extraneous opening single quote
removed just before “Do you happen to write poetry”.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_41">Page 41</a>: Missing closing quote mark added
after “It was a quasi sonnet entitled ‘The Jewish Poet.’”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_44">Page 44</a>: “sombrero” was printed as
“comprero”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_48">Page 48</a>: “This he thought was very reasonable
theory” was printed that way.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_49">Page 49</a>: The second occurrence of “Debates
Union” was printed as “Debate’s Union”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_51">Page 51</a>: “Liberty: the Last Phase,” was
printed as “Liberty: the Last Phrase,”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_57">Page 57</a>: Extraneous closing quote removed
after “of life and experience.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_62">Page 62</a>: “he never forgot” was printed as “he
never forget”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_88">Page 88</a>: “Cycle Valley” was printed that
way.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_89">Page 89</a>: “it did before” was printed as “it
did befire”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_90">Page 90</a>: “Thomas More” was printed as “Thomas
Moore”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_94">Page 94</a>: “that varnished period” was printed
that way.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_106">Page 106</a>: “It would not have mattered” was
printed as “I would not have mattered”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_107">Page 107</a>: Extraneous closing quote removed
after “condition did not prevail.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_108">Page 108</a>: “no other poet” was printed as “no
other post”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_118">Page 118</a>: “just as fervently” was printed as
“just as feverently”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_121">Page 121</a>: “It might ever more accurately”
was printed that way; “ever” may be a typo for “even.”</p>

<p><a href="#Page_122">Page 122</a>: “significance” was printed as
“signifcance”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_139">Page 139</a>: “battered daylight” was printed as
“bettered daylight”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_140">Page 140</a>: “knows more about crime” was
printed as “know more about crime”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_146">Page 146</a>: “was essential” was printed as
“was ensential”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_146">Page 146</a>: “debate develop as it likes” was
printed as “debate develop as it like”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_146">Page 146</a>: “Some year ago” was printed that
way.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_149">Page 149</a>: “Grey Beards at Play” was printed
that way, but should be “Greybeards”.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_150">Page 150</a>: “I consider it as being” was
printed as “I consider is as being”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_158">Page 158</a>: “Gerard Manley Hopkins” was

printed as “Both was the first poem”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_171">Page 171</a>: The stanza of a poem is reproduced
here as it was printed in the original book, but differs from
reproductions of that stanza in most other sources. </p>

<p><a href="#Page_172">Page 172</a>: “patiche” probably should be
“pastiche”.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_175">Page 175</a>: “Benet, Stephen Vincent” was
printed as “Bent, Stephen Vincent”; changed here.</p>
